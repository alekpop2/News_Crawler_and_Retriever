LUKE BRYAN MEATy Backside Broke My Fall üçëüôèüèΩ,"
           Luke Bryan 's counting his blessings for the extra padding that saved him when he took a nasty tumble onstage during his latest concert stop. 
       
           We caught up with the country star at Cecconi's Monday in L.A. ... and he joked his weekend slip-and-fall wasn't as painful as it looked 'cause he's got ""a whole lot of meat back there"" -- referring to his butt, of course -- which softened the landing. 
       
           ICYMI, the initial buzz was Luke  went horizontal  Saturday -- during his performance at the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver -- due to a fan's phone that was left on the stage. 
       
           But, a later video angle showed he simply slipped on the floor ... perhaps on some moisture or liquid. Either way, Luke's told us he's still scratching his head over what exactly sent him plummeting. 
       
           He clearly didn't mind being the butt of the joke, though, as he spoke to us -- and also by the way he reacted with good humor seconds after going down. 
       
           In the viral clip of his fall, you can see Luke staying down for a hot second ... before brushing it off with a laugh as he jumped back up 'cause the show must go on, of course!

Jill Scott Blown Up for Chris Brown Defense ... After His Quavo Attack,"
           Jill Scott  isn't going to let  Chris Brown ‚Äôs checkered past block her enjoyment of listening to him lyrically pummel  Quavo , and she's been fending off critics who wished she didn't cape for Chris!!! 
       
           The ripple effect from Chris' brutal ""Weakest Link"" graced Jill's radar over the weekend and she couldn't help, but gush over the embattled singer's MC skills ... ‚Äú@chrisbrown is amazing. How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap‚Ä¶ like THAT?‚Äù wrote Scott on Sunday morning. 
       
           ‚ÄúBeyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional üî•. There‚Äôs nothing to debate.‚Äù 
       
           The praise struck a nerve with fans on X, many felt CB had gone too far on the diss -- especially with his record of domestic violence with  Rihanna . 
       
           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments. 
       
           Despite the backlash, people are enjoying CB's spill --. the song has nearly 2 million plays on his YouTube channel, and would inevitably rack up more if he put the song on streaming. 
       
           Quavo is currently on the clock.

"Busta Rhymes Phones Down, and Put Ya Hands Where My Eyes Can See!!!","
           Busta Rhymes  ain't about to stomach Hollywood-type crowds at his performance -- even if the gig happens to be in the Hollywood Hills!!! 
       
           That was the plotline when  Dwyane Wade  and cannabis co. Jeeter recruited Bussa Bus to perform at the after-party of their 420 ""High Dining"" event ... and while he was trying to do his duty, he wasn't getting high vibes from the crowd. 
       
           Basically, the audience wasn't giving Busta the energy he felt his classic tune ""Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See"" deserved -- so, he cut the music and told the onlookers to get their minds right. 
       
           Busta says he, along with  Spliff Star  and  DJ Scratchator , have been ripping mics since childhood, and he'll be damned if anyone doesn't respect his hip hop hierarchy!!! 
       
           The audience woke up for take 2, and Busta wooed the fans before getting a surprise of his own -- Team Jeeter crafted a new cannabis strain in Busta's honor, adding him to the family alongside D. Wade. 
       
           The Dungeon Dragon already spits fire ... now he has the smoke to match!!!

Delta Burke I Tried Crystal Meth to Lose Lbs. ... Didn't Eat for 5 Days!!!,"
           Delta Burke  is revealing the shocking lengths to which she went just to drop a few pounds in her heyday -- using crystal meth as an appetite suppressant! 
       
           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days."" 
       
           Despite her attempts to lose weight, Delta recalled still being criticized for her body, which greatly impacted her mental health ... and even led to her early exit from 'DW.' 
       
           While Delta's admission might seem shocking, she isn't the first celeb to seek drug assistance in order to achieve a body transformation. 
       
           The difference is ... now A-listers get those drugs prescribed, as more and more openly turn to weight-loss meds like Wegovy and Ozempic. 
       
           Oprah ,  Amy Schumer ,  Tracy Morgan ,  Sharon Osbourne  and  Chelsea Handler  have all admitted to  using weight-loss drugs . 
       
           Hey, beats the hell outta meth!

Meek Mill New Hummer EV Almost Killed Me!!! Sticking with Tesla,"
           Meek Mill  is regretting his latest auto purchase ... the ""Dreamchasers"" rapper posted a video of his new Hummer EV vehicle and the evidence is as sour as a lemon!!! 
       
           Back in March, Meek posted a flick of a wrecked GMC but recently revealed how it happened -- he claims the brake pedal fell off, and the car even started driving on him ... while it was in park!!! 
       
           According to Meek, he barely had the whip for 4 hours but witnessed several safety features fail on him, including the airbags ... which he, unfortunately, experienced during the crash!!! 
       
           GMC offered up the typical corporate response and requested Meek send them a DM on X for further info, but Meek might have moved on to other car makers. 
       
           Meek says it was his first non-Tesla electric vehicle and by the sounds of things, he likely won't abandon  Elon Musk 's products again. 
       
           Of course, he might have a similar issue with a Cybertruck, if that's his jam.

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

MINNESOTA CAR CRASH Up in Flames ... Driver Saved by Brave Passersby!!!,"
           A bunch of good Samaritans banded together to save a driver from a burning car at the very last second ... and the harrowing rescue is all on video. 
       
           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. 
       
           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. 
       
           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. 
       
           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. 
       
           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries.

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"
           Kim Kardashian 's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. 
       
           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyonc√© Fans,"
           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"
           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in '63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn't going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. 
       
           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

           While her stylists worked their magic, Beyonc√© narrated, ""Now that C√©cred is known for the quality in what it does for your hair, I think it's about time I show y'all what it does for my hair."" 
       
           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!"" 
       
           Beyonc√©'s dad,  Mathew Knowles , already stepped up to back his daughter ... telling TMZ she definitely knows a thing or 2 about  keeping hair happy and healthy , considering he and   Tina Knowles  ran a successful salon in Houston for nearly 2 decades. 
       
           And, judging by Bey's hair care routine, looks like her products are totally making waves. Now, will that be enough to silence the hate? Of course not.

           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery.

           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

Jake Plummer Down For Pat Tillman HOF Honor ... But I Know His Legacy Will Go On Regardless,"
           If  Pat Tillman  ever gets honored at the Pro Football Hall of Fame,  Jake Plummer  will be the first one there for the ceremony ... although he tells  TMZ Sports  if it doesn't happen, he knows the hero's legacy will go on regardless. 
       
           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too. 
       
           ""I think about him a lot,"" Jake said, ""and I know he's inspiring a lot of people to be better."" 
       
           We discussed Pat's legacy on a previous episode of  Last Days , available on all podcast platforms.

Pete Rose Roasts Ohtani Over Betting Scandal ... At Autoraph Signing,"
           Pete Rose  trolled  Shohei Ohtani  over the weekend, poking fun at the Dodgers superstar at an autograph signing ... all over the  Ippei Mizhuara  betting scandal. 
       
           ""SORRY I BET ON BASEBALL"" and ""OHTANI IS SORRY ALSO"" are two of the phrases the hit king signed at the Fiterman Sports Group signing in St. Paul, Minnesota ... attended by a large group of collectors. 
       
           83-year-old Rose also signed ... ""I WISH I HAD AN INTERPRETER"" 
       
           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it. 
       
           Major League Baseball has pressed pause on their investigation, opting to wait until Mizuhara's criminal case is closed, to determine if they'll investigate Ohtani, or anyone else involved, any further. 
       
           But, you know where Pete stands.

'TMZ Presents Arnold & Sly' Torn Pec Forced 'Rocky II' Change ... Sly Brings the Pain!!!,"
           Sylvester Stallone  came within a hair's breadth of tanking ""Rocky II"" because of a gruesome injury, and you won't believe how he powered through to shoot the flick! 
       
           Sly and  Arnold Schwarzenegger  sat down with  Harvey , and for the first time ever together they talked about their unbelievable rivalry and how it blossomed into a close friendship. 
       
           Arnold's trainer and compadre, bodybuilding legend  Franco Columbu , trained Sly for ""Rocky II,"" and when Franco challenged Sly to a bench press competition, the actor was game ... until he ripped his pec off the bone. 
       
           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury. 
       
           As Sly put it to us ... pushing through the pain is just what driven folks like Arnold and himself did to make it to the top. 
       
           ""TMZ Presents Arnold & Sly: Rivals, Friends, Icons"" airs Tuesday at 8/7 Central on FOX.

NASCAR Massive Crash At Talladega ... Tyler Reddick Ends Up Winning,"
           A brutal crash went down in the closing moments of NASCAR's Geico 500 at Talladega on Sunday ... taking out several cars in the final lap and paving the way for  Tyler Reddick  to come away with the win. 
       
           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega. 
       
           Michael Jordan  was proud of his driver's crazy win ... and celebrated with his family, including Reddick's son. 
       
           This is Reddick's sixth Cup Series win of his career ... and given how he earned it, it may be one of the most memorable.

           Adrien Broner   says  Devin Haney   needs him now more than ever -- after suffering the first loss of his career on Saturday -- with AB challenging the 31-1 boxer to a fight! 
       
           34-year-old Broner, 35-4, made a video addressing 25-year-old Haney after Saturday's fight at Barclays in Brooklyn ... one of the most shocking upsets of the year. 
       
           ""I know everybody waiting on my reaction, but I'mma just tell the truth,"" Broner said in an Instagram video. 
       
           ""Ay Devin! You gotta fight me now n****! S***, right now, you need me n****!"" 
       
           The fight offer was followed by some trolling ... AB took a shot at Haney's father,  Bill , who he's had beef with for some time. 
       
           ""Hold on, anybody seen Bill? Where the f*** is Bill at?!"" Broner said. ""Nah, we know where Devin at. Devin probably trying to get his thoughts together and s***. He'll be alright."" 
       
           ""Where the f*** Bill at?! Bill?!"" 
       
           Broner wasn't the only boxer throwing shade at the Haneys ...  Gervonta 'Tank' Davis , the only fighter to beat  Ryan Garcia ,   also trolled Devin and his crew.

           Devin said that's fake news ... but,  that loss  on Saturday was all too real. Stay tuned for DH's next move.

Comedian Elayne Boosler I Was Arrested At Dodger Game ... All 'Cause Of My Bag?!?,"
           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

Matt Ryan Former NFL MVP Retires At 38,"
           Matty Ice is putting his career on ice for good -- former NFL MVP  Matt Ryan  is officially retiring from professional football after 15 seasons. 
       
           The Atlanta Falcons great -- who played all but one season with the organization -- released a heartfelt goodbye to the game on Monday ... saying it was time to hang up the helmet. 
       
           ""Today, 16 years after being drafted, my childhood dream has officially come to an end,"" Ryan said. 
       
           ""I'm honored to retire as a Falcon."" 
       
           Ryan -- the third overall pick in 2008 -- played his best season in 2016 ... leading the league in passer rating and being named first-team All-Pro. 
       
           He threw for nearly 63,000 yards during his time under center ... and had 381 touchdowns and just 183 interceptions. 
       
           Ryan -- the franchise's all-time wins leader for a quarterback -- led the Falcons to a NFC Championship in 2017. 
       
           Ryan shouted out several members of the Falcons organization ... including owner  Arthur Blank  and teammates like  Tony Gonzalez ,  Michael Turner ,  Roddy White  and, of course,  Julio Jones . 
       
           ""I truly believe that football life is not simple about what you do but rather who you do it with and I was a better player because of the people I was surrounded by,"" Ryan added. 
       
           The four-time Pro Bowler played his final season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2022 ... going 4-7-1 in 12 games. 
       
           He spent the 2023 campaign working for CBS on NFL Sundays.

           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain't all that. 
       
           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man's new title ... and it's safe to say she's pissed, 'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. 
       
           ""My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met,"" Bonilla said. ""He hasn't stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career."" 
       
           ""It's hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense,"" she added. ""I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind."" 
       
           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run. 
       
           ""I am proud of you, and our son is proud of you."" 
       
           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a ""blessing"" to start a family. 
       
           Something Bonilla will certainly like -- Gobert was just named a finalist for the NBA's DPOY once again this season ... and that award actually means something.

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden .

           He's still a couple years out before Rubi can legally entertain the inquiry ... but he's going for it anyway. 
       
           At any rate, Ddot tells us he'd rather see Drake & Co. unified than ripping each other apart on the 'Gram. 
       
           Hip Hop got Ddot off the streets ... he wants to keep it that way.

Singer Alessia Cara 'Memba Her?!,"
           Canadian singer  Alessia Cara  was just 18 years old when she skyrocketed to fame -- reaching millions across the globe and topping the music charts with her hit song ""Here"" back in 2015. 
       
           ""Here"" peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, and her massive popularity continued into 2018 when she won a Grammy for Best New Artist. Other hit songs of Alessia's include ""Beautiful"" and ""Stay"", produced by  Zedd . 
       
           In 2019, she garnered enough success to show out at The Met Gala. 
       
           ""I'm sorry if I seem uninterested, Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent ... Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here!"" 
       
           Guess what she looks like now!

"Chingy Music Industry Full of BS ... Don't Take The Bait, Drake & Kendrick!!!","
           Chingy  is ready for his second wind of music success, but he's wary of the industry -- telling us he's been burned by bad rumors and beef, and doesn't want to see future artists suffer the same fate!!! 
       
           TMZ Hip Hop caught up with the ""Right Thurr"" rapper ahead of the debut of his ""Unsung"" episode on TV One. He's on his ""Nu Beginnings"" wave courtesy of his brand-new single released today, but still has a sour taste in his mouth over the  Sidney Starr  situation  he says  killed his career climb. 
       
           Chingy recalls being blackballed when Sidney, a transgender model, lied about sleeping with him back in the day, and tells us her eventual apology barely did any real damage control. 
       
           The St. Louis rapper came out the gate with a multi-platinum debut in 2003, and put many bullets on the Billboard charts. 
       
           However, he says he saw, firsthand, how easily fans can forget about you when the mainstream machine isn't pumping your product. 
       
           Speaking of the mainstream, Chingy also fears  Drake  and  Kendrick Lamar 's  current clash  is getting way too intense ... and the back-and-forth stingers could escalate to violence if they're not careful. 
       
           Rap hasn't been keeping the peace as of late, but Chingy feels it can be done.

"Spring Breakers Can't Stop Brawlin', Trash the Ocean","
           Spring Break reached rowdy new heights outside Savannah, GA ... as several violent fights broke out, despite increased police presence. 
       
           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well."" 
       
           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down.

'90 Day Fianc√©' Liz Slams 'Weakling' Big Ed For Calling Off Wedding!!!,"
           Big Ed Brown  and  Liz Woods  have called it quits again ... and it seems to be for real this time. 
       
           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months. 
       
           Good luck to 'em both ... but we'll miss the drama.

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

           When Tina asked how much time she needed to get ready, Ashanti coyly replied ""9 months"" ... and also captioned the post ""Baby, baby, baby, baby"" and clearly wasn't referencing her 2002 hit!!! 
       
           It was Nelly who first tipped off fans -- way  back in December  -- when he gleefully kept rubbing on Ashanti's belly. It wasn't hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they've made it official.

           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo.

           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time.

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend.

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"
           9:45 AM PT  --  Kid Cudi  just posted a video update detailing what happened during his jump offstage, ""This is what happens when a 40-year-old man tries to prance around off stage like he's 26."" 
       
           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

Dwyane Wade 'High Dining' For Best Buds ... Gabrielle Makes Magic!!!,"
           Dwyane Wade 's annual ""High Dining"" dinner, in honor of 420, went down with several of the NBA great's famous pals rolling up to join the festivities -- including a few surprises. 
       
           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities. 
       
           His wife  Gabrielle Union  stood in as magician  Kevin Li 's assistant -- thankfully everyone kept their hands to themselves, and no one was sliced and diced on the table. üëÄ 
       
           The event also debuted Jeeter and the  Bob Marley  estate's master collaboration -- a 4.2-gram pre-roll packaged in a guitar case ... in other words, a Jah-endorsed rollout! 
       
           Bob's grandson, Grammy-nominated singer  Skip Marley  also performed ""Jamming"" and ""One Love"" -- and the significance of having the latest generation of Marley hitmakers present needed no explanation. 
       
           Neither did D. Wade's self-review of the event!!!

Ne-Yo Gets Warning from Carl Thomas ... Throuple Not All It's Cracked Up to Be!!!,"
           Ne-Yo  is happily living his truth as a non-monogamous man -- but his R&B OG  Carl Thomas  is forewarning him that 2 heads aren't always better than one!!! 
       
           The ""Because Of You"" singer was turning heads in L.A. yesterday when TMZ Hip Hop caught him at The Grove with both of his girlfriends -- and, though he told us he's not looking to get hitched anytime soon, he IS  loving the lifestyle !!! 
       
           Carl's a little older than Ne-Yo but added his own 2 cents to the convo after The Shade Room reposted our clip -- he says he once entertained a throuple situation but says time and wisdom changed his ways. 
       
           The singer was once a platinum-selling powerhouse on  Diddy 's Bad Boy Records in the early 2000s, when you gotta imagine he had plenty of options in the female department. But, now he's testifying to being a one-woman man, and seems to believe Ne-Yo will eventually narrow down his options too. 
       
           Ne-Yo's fresh off  a divorce , and told us everyone's situation varies.

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"
           10:16 PM PT  -- A rep for  Kanye West  tells TMZ ... ""'Grabbed' is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted."" 
       
           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

Damian Lillard Estranged Wife Clowns GloRilla ... After DUI Arrest,"
           Damian Lillard 's estranged wife was apparently not a fan of  GloRilla  recently shooting her shot at the NBA superstar ... the hooper's ex clowned the Memphis rapper shortly after she was arrested for DUI. 
       
           GloRilla  was arrested  in Georgia on Tuesday for suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container, as well as another traffic charge. 
       
           Kay'La  -- who was married to Dame from September 2021 until he  filed for divorce  in October 2023 -- saw the legal trouble as an opportunity to roast the rapper ... this after she said she wanted to be with the Milwaukee Bucks guard. 
       
           ""Free GloLillard,"" Kay'La wrote on a photo of Glo's mugshot on Instagram, adding the hashtag, ""#sisterwifeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è""

           ""She mad, hurt, and taking it out on the wrong person,"" a follower commented. 
       
           Others believe Kay'La -- who has three kids with Lillard -- was joking ... with most people feeling she missed the mark.

           Kodak Black  can now place his recent drug possession case in his rearview mirror ... the last significant charge in the case was tossed out this week!!! 
       
           Court docs obtained by TMZ Hip Hop show a judge just dismissed the remaining tampering charge against the Florida rapper -- this after previously tossing the drug possession charges, back in February, after Kodak showed he had a prescription for the drugs. 
       
           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence???

           He goes on to say that the prestige that Grammys have historically held still carries weight in his mind -- which is why he says it sucks to get strung along for so many years without a prize, especially when you get booked to perform -- like he has many, many times.

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out.

           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

Taylor Swift Smooches Travis Kelce In 'Fortnight' Vid,"
           Taylor Swift  can't hide she's totally smitten with BF  Travis Kelce  in her new YouTube promotional clip for her first music video, ""Fortnight,"" off her recently released 11th album. 
       
           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment. 
       
           But Taylor's not giving any love to her ex  Joe Alwyn  on her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" which was officially released Friday. 
       
           In one song, ""So Long London,"" Taylor  rips into Alwyn  for his alleged depression, which she seemingly attributes to their break-up. 
       
           Taylor also took a major shot at  Kim Kardashian  in another tune, 'thanK you aIMee,""  comparing the reality star to a schoolyard bully  and reigniting their feud from years ago.

O.J. SIMPSON BANK OF AMERICA CREDIT CARD Up for AUCTION,"
           O.J. Simpson 's Bank of America credit card has hit the auction block ... and let's just say the seller is banking on it raking in some serious cash. 
       
           Jonathan Lepore  is selling the business account card over at  Goldin Auctions  ... telling TMZ he snagged the piece of plastic, which expired in 2023, on eBay last summer for a steal at $70, adding it to his trove of sports memorabilia. 
       
           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

Kanye & Bianca Out For An Afternoon Drive ... Battery Report No Big Deal,"
           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

Al Harrington My 4/20 Advice ... 'Get High As F***!!!',"
           Ex-NBA hooper and current weed entrepreneur  Al Harrington  has some solid advice for any newbies looking to celebrate the 4/20 holiday this year ... telling  TMZ Sports  it's pretty simple -- ""get high as f***!!!"" 
       
           Harrington knows his stuff -- the guy built an entire company around his love for Mary Jane ... serving as the CEO of the Viola brand. 
       
           He's doing pretty well for himself, too ... with the company valued at over $100 million. 
       
           Harrington -- who played 16 seasons in the league for a number of teams -- told us he'll be in NYC for a three-day ""4/20 Tour"" this weekend ... 'cause apparently, the dude needs way more than 24 hours to show his love for cannabis. 
       
           Harrington has been a huge advocate for the benefits of marijuana -- in 2017, he sat down with former NBA commish  David Stern  ... and the conversation helped the league eventually take weed off the banned substances list. 
       
           As for folks looking to dabble with some doobies, Harrington says there's no need to complicate it ... just puff, puff, pass and enjoy yourself.

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight."" 
       
           It'd be massive ... but first, Saturday night's super fight! üëä

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more.

           Arnold Schwarzenegger  epically punked  Sylvester Stallone  into signing on for the most disastrous film of Sly's career, and that's exactly what Arnold wanted to happen! 
       
           Arnold and Sly sat down with  Harvey  for a candid, sometimes stunning convo about the intense rivalry between the 2 mega-action stars. 
       
           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

Brenden Rice Jerry's Son Won't Wear No. 80 In NFL ... Determined To Create Own Legacy,"
           Another Rice is making his way to the NFL this season ... but don't expect him to look anything like  Jerry  on gamedays -- no,  Brenden Rice  tells  TMZ Sports  he's gunning to be his own man when it comes time to perform on Sundays. 
       
           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad. 
       
           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry. 
       
           ""I would love to go ahead and make my own impact,"" he said. 
       
           As for off the field, Brenden doesn't mind being like pops there ... because he just teamed up with Breathe Right to recreate the famous ""Air Jerry"" ad that the elder Rice was a part of in his heyday. 
       
           Brenden took pics with the nasal strip to emulate his pops for the company -- and he told us he was stoked to get to wear the product while on the gridiron ... just like Jerry. 
       
           As for where Brenden will be seen next in the strips ... he said he's been hearing a lot from the Chargers, Cardinals, Buccaneers, Eagles, and Jets. 
       
           But, he said he's down to play anywhere ... just as long as they give him a shot to ""create my own legacy and my own name.""

LUKE BRYAN MEATy Backside Broke My Fall üçëüôèüèΩ,"
           Luke Bryan 's counting his blessings for the extra padding that saved him when he took a nasty tumble onstage during his latest concert stop. 
       
           We caught up with the country star at Cecconi's Monday in L.A. ... and he joked his weekend slip-and-fall wasn't as painful as it looked 'cause he's got ""a whole lot of meat back there"" -- referring to his butt, of course -- which softened the landing.

           But, a later video angle showed he simply slipped on the floor ... perhaps on some moisture or liquid. Either way, Luke's told us he's still scratching his head over what exactly sent him plummeting. 
       
           He clearly didn't mind being the butt of the joke, though, as he spoke to us -- and also by the way he reacted with good humor seconds after going down. 
       
           In the viral clip of his fall, you can see Luke staying down for a hot second ... before brushing it off with a laugh as he jumped back up 'cause the show must go on, of course!

           That was the plotline when  Dwyane Wade  and cannabis co. Jeeter recruited Bussa Bus to perform at the after-party of their 420 ""High Dining"" event ... and while he was trying to do his duty, he wasn't getting high vibes from the crowd. 
       
           Basically, the audience wasn't giving Busta the energy he felt his classic tune ""Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See"" deserved -- so, he cut the music and told the onlookers to get their minds right. 
       
           Busta says he, along with  Spliff Star  and  DJ Scratchator , have been ripping mics since childhood, and he'll be damned if anyone doesn't respect his hip hop hierarchy!!!

Delta Burke I Tried Crystal Meth to Lose Lbs. ... Didn't Eat for 5 Days!!!,"
           Delta Burke  is revealing the shocking lengths to which she went just to drop a few pounds in her heyday -- using crystal meth as an appetite suppressant! 
       
           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days."" 
       
           Despite her attempts to lose weight, Delta recalled still being criticized for her body, which greatly impacted her mental health ... and even led to her early exit from 'DW.' 
       
           While Delta's admission might seem shocking, she isn't the first celeb to seek drug assistance in order to achieve a body transformation. 
       
           The difference is ... now A-listers get those drugs prescribed, as more and more openly turn to weight-loss meds like Wegovy and Ozempic. 
       
           Oprah ,  Amy Schumer ,  Tracy Morgan ,  Sharon Osbourne  and  Chelsea Handler  have all admitted to  using weight-loss drugs .

Jill Scott Blown Up for Chris Brown Defense ... After His Quavo Attack,"
           Jill Scott  isn't going to let  Chris Brown ‚Äôs checkered past block her enjoyment of listening to him lyrically pummel  Quavo , and she's been fending off critics who wished she didn't cape for Chris!!! 
       
           The ripple effect from Chris' brutal ""Weakest Link"" graced Jill's radar over the weekend and she couldn't help, but gush over the embattled singer's MC skills ... ‚Äú@chrisbrown is amazing. How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap‚Ä¶ like THAT?‚Äù wrote Scott on Sunday morning. 
       
           ‚ÄúBeyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional üî•. There‚Äôs nothing to debate.‚Äù 
       
           The praise struck a nerve with fans on X, many felt CB had gone too far on the diss -- especially with his record of domestic violence with  Rihanna . 
       
           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments. 
       
           Despite the backlash, people are enjoying CB's spill --. the song has nearly 2 million plays on his YouTube channel, and would inevitably rack up more if he put the song on streaming.

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"
           Kim Kardashian 's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. 
       
           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

MINNESOTA CAR CRASH Up in Flames ... Driver Saved by Brave Passersby!!!,"
           A bunch of good Samaritans banded together to save a driver from a burning car at the very last second ... and the harrowing rescue is all on video. 
       
           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. 
       
           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. 
       
           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. 
       
           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. 
       
           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries.

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"
           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in '63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn't going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. 
       
           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

           It was quite the eventful trip for the Mahomeses -- as we previously reported, the couple was  heckled by Raiders fans  while out at dinner together last week.

           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!""

           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery.

           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted.

           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

Jake Plummer Down For Pat Tillman HOF Honor ... But I Know His Legacy Will Go On Regardless,"
           If  Pat Tillman  ever gets honored at the Pro Football Hall of Fame,  Jake Plummer  will be the first one there for the ceremony ... although he tells  TMZ Sports  if it doesn't happen, he knows the hero's legacy will go on regardless. 
       
           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too. 
       
           ""I think about him a lot,"" Jake said, ""and I know he's inspiring a lot of people to be better."" 
       
           We discussed Pat's legacy on a previous episode of  Last Days , available on all podcast platforms.

T-Pain Victim in ATL Hit-and-Run ... Vows REVENGE!!!,"
           So much for Sunday Funday  ...  T-Pain 's weekend came to a crashing end in Atlanta, when a speeding driver severely rear-ended the Auto-Tune Don's vehicle, and fled the scene without a word!!! 
       
           A calm yet irritated T-Pain went live from the scene of the accident and pointed out a very valuable clue for police ... the driver had left their bumper in the street, and it was only a matter of time before they matched the silver Chevy with the missing part. 
       
           Turns out he was right ... T-Pain posted an update, letting fans know the driver had been caught, and gauging by his use of the üòà emoji, he plans on showing the guy no mercy. 
       
           He says the principle of the driver not stopping to check on their well-being is what got him hot, although it appeared his own personal driver was headed to the hospital for medical attention. 
       
           The crash forced T-Pain to alter his packed itinerary but something tells us he'll make up for it in legal justice.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

Pete Rose Roasts Ohtani Over Betting Scandal ... At Autoraph Signing,"
           Pete Rose  trolled  Shohei Ohtani  over the weekend, poking fun at the Dodgers superstar at an autograph signing ... all over the  Ippei Mizhuara  betting scandal. 
       
           ""SORRY I BET ON BASEBALL"" and ""OHTANI IS SORRY ALSO"" are two of the phrases the hit king signed at the Fiterman Sports Group signing in St. Paul, Minnesota ... attended by a large group of collectors. 
       
           83-year-old Rose also signed ... ""I WISH I HAD AN INTERPRETER"" 
       
           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it. 
       
           Major League Baseball has pressed pause on their investigation, opting to wait until Mizuhara's criminal case is closed, to determine if they'll investigate Ohtani, or anyone else involved, any further.

Comedian Elayne Boosler I Was Arrested At Dodger Game ... All 'Cause Of My Bag?!?,"
           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

NASCAR Massive Crash At Talladega ... Tyler Reddick Ends Up Winning,"
           A brutal crash went down in the closing moments of NASCAR's Geico 500 at Talladega on Sunday ... taking out several cars in the final lap and paving the way for  Tyler Reddick  to come away with the win. 
       
           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega. 
       
           Michael Jordan  was proud of his driver's crazy win ... and celebrated with his family, including Reddick's son. 
       
           This is Reddick's sixth Cup Series win of his career ... and given how he earned it, it may be one of the most memorable.

           Sly and  Arnold Schwarzenegger  sat down with  Harvey , and for the first time ever together they talked about their unbelievable rivalry and how it blossomed into a close friendship. 
       
           Arnold's trainer and compadre, bodybuilding legend  Franco Columbu , trained Sly for ""Rocky II,"" and when Franco challenged Sly to a bench press competition, the actor was game ... until he ripped his pec off the bone. 
       
           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury. 
       
           As Sly put it to us ... pushing through the pain is just what driven folks like Arnold and himself did to make it to the top.

           The fight offer was followed by some trolling ... AB took a shot at Haney's father,  Bill , who he's had beef with for some time.

           He threw for nearly 63,000 yards during his time under center ... and had 381 touchdowns and just 183 interceptions.

           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain't all that.

           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

"Kanye West Jumping Into Rap Beef ... Drops Drake, J. Cole Diss","
           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"
           9:45 AM PT  --  Kid Cudi  just posted a video update detailing what happened during his jump offstage, ""This is what happens when a 40-year-old man tries to prance around off stage like he's 26."" 
       
           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

Nicki Minaj Almost Nailed by Object ... Hurls it Back Into Crowd!!!,"
           Nicki Minaj  will not stand for objects being thrown at her -- giving one concertgoer a taste of their own medicine. 
       
           Check it out .. during a performance of her hit song ""Starships,"" the rapper swats away an item as it flies toward her face. Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. 
       
           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. 
       
           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows.

           Dwyane Wade 's annual ""High Dining"" dinner, in honor of 420, went down with several of the NBA great's famous pals rolling up to join the festivities -- including a few surprises. 
       
           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities. 
       
           His wife  Gabrielle Union  stood in as magician  Kevin Li 's assistant -- thankfully everyone kept their hands to themselves, and no one was sliced and diced on the table. üëÄ 
       
           The event also debuted Jeeter and the  Bob Marley  estate's master collaboration -- a 4.2-gram pre-roll packaged in a guitar case ... in other words, a Jah-endorsed rollout! 
       
           Bob's grandson, Grammy-nominated singer  Skip Marley  also performed ""Jamming"" and ""One Love"" -- and the significance of having the latest generation of Marley hitmakers present needed no explanation.

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend. 
       
           As they say, out with the old, in with the new -- even for an Ellwood classic.

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"
           4:37 PM PT --  Bam Margera  just posted video to Instagram showing a portion of the attempts he says he made to call 911 for police assistance last week ... recorded before he ended up taking matters into his own hands, fighting off a threatening stranger. 
       
           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. 
       
           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam.

           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden .

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

Ashanti I'm Preggo with Nelly's Baby ... And We're Engaged Too!!!,"
           2:33 PM PT  -- According to  Essence ,  Nelly  and  Ashanti  are also engaged -- so big day for them. 
       
           Ashanti says, ""This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope, and anticipation. Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc√©, and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience."" 
       
           Ashanti is finally confirming what we've suspected for months now ... she and Nelly are indeed expecting a child together! 
       
           On Wednesday, Ashanti posted a comedy skit on Instagram, which showed her momager  Tina Douglas  rushing her to the stage ahead of a concert at Barclays Center. 
       
           When Tina asked how much time she needed to get ready, Ashanti coyly replied ""9 months"" ... and also captioned the post ""Baby, baby, baby, baby"" and clearly wasn't referencing her 2002 hit!!! 
       
           It was Nelly who first tipped off fans -- way  back in December  -- when he gleefully kept rubbing on Ashanti's belly. It wasn't hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they've made it official. 
       
           The family news has been a long time coming -- the couple initially started dating in 2003!!! 
       
           We got soon-to-be uncle  Ja Rule  to give Ashanti and Nelly  some parenting advice  not too long ago. Doing his best Hallmark card impression, Ja told us the main ingredient for a healthy family recipe is love. 
       
           Congratulations to the happy couple! Musical prodigy now uploading.

           YG's back in the saddle with his day one collaborator  Mustard , and L.A. radio is about to experience a revival of sorts -- they're releasing the upcoming compilation, ""Just Re'd Up 3"" soon and point him to the action!!! 
       
           Hip Hop has been offering tons of just that as of late, and we had to get his thoughts on Kendrick Lamar vs. Everybody, including his homie J. Cole. 
       
           YG has records with both Kendrick and Cole but didn't come down on the Dreamville rapper for apologizing like  other culture critics . 
       
           He's thinking like a boss more than ever. YG and his label recently inked a multi-album partnership deal with BMG, after officially departing Def Jam Records -- so, more than ever, his career is his to control.

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

"Spring Breakers Can't Stop Brawlin', Trash the Ocean","
           Spring Break reached rowdy new heights outside Savannah, GA ... as several violent fights broke out, despite increased police presence. 
       
           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well."" 
       
           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down.

Damian Lillard Estranged Wife Clowns GloRilla ... After DUI Arrest,"
           Damian Lillard 's estranged wife was apparently not a fan of  GloRilla  recently shooting her shot at the NBA superstar ... the hooper's ex clowned the Memphis rapper shortly after she was arrested for DUI. 
       
           GloRilla  was arrested  in Georgia on Tuesday for suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container, as well as another traffic charge. 
       
           Kay'La  -- who was married to Dame from September 2021 until he  filed for divorce  in October 2023 -- saw the legal trouble as an opportunity to roast the rapper ... this after she said she wanted to be with the Milwaukee Bucks guard. 
       
           ""Free GloLillard,"" Kay'La wrote on a photo of Glo's mugshot on Instagram, adding the hashtag, ""#sisterwifeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"" 
       
           Fans instantly caught on to the shade ... and had plenty to say about the cryptic message. 
       
           ""She mad, hurt, and taking it out on the wrong person,"" a follower commented. 
       
           Others believe Kay'La -- who has three kids with Lillard -- was joking ... with most people feeling she missed the mark. 
       
           Another wrote ... ""Didn‚Äôt he file for a divorce üò©üò© this is cringey af."" 
       
           Glo, nor Dame, has responded ... not surprising given the hooper has an NBA playoff series coming up.

"Kodak Black I'm Off the Hook!!! Drug, Tampering Charges Dismissed","
           Kodak Black  can now place his recent drug possession case in his rearview mirror ... the last significant charge in the case was tossed out this week!!! 
       
           Court docs obtained by TMZ Hip Hop show a judge just dismissed the remaining tampering charge against the Florida rapper -- this after previously tossing the drug possession charges, back in February, after Kodak showed he had a prescription for the drugs. 
       
           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them. 
       
           His new single, ""Stressed Out,"" is probably a fitting description of his mood prior to getting the good news.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"

           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

           He goes on to say that the prestige that Grammys have historically held still carries weight in his mind -- which is why he says it sucks to get strung along for so many years without a prize, especially when you get booked to perform -- like he has many, many times.

           The tenured music and cultural critic hopped on ""TMZ Live"" on Thursday and pinpointed what he feels are dings in Drake's armor ... mainly his comeback response, which Tour√© isn't all that impressed with. 
       
           Drake has been owning up to his ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" track ... using the lyrics to tease both  Metro Boomin  and Kendrick's manager on social media ... but Tour√© feels sneaky tactics pale in comparison to the points K. Dot has already put on the board. 
       
           Remember, Kendrick's feature on  Future  and Metro's  ""Like That"" record  has been No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 3 straight weeks now and Tour√© is daring any DJ to try and drop ""Push Ups"" in the club ... he says the song will bomb!!! 
       
           Tour√© says Kendrick and everyone else is well within their rights to fire back at Drake after years of sneak disses ... and he's strongly against giving Drake a handicap for not showing signs of obliteration. 
       
           It's an interesting viewpoint ... especially since Drake claimed it was Kendrick who gets the benefit of the doubt over him. 
       
           At any rate, Tour√©'s convinced a Kendrick nuke is coming. His backers are speaking similar code.

"Ne-Yo Let Polygamists Do What They Want ... But, No Marriage For Me","
           Ne-Yo  wants the government to stay out of his love life ... saying he thinks polygamists should be allowed to marry multiple people -- while holding hands with his two partners! 
       
           We caught up with the singer-songwriter at The Grove in Los Angeles Thursday ... and he made his feelings pretty clear ... consenting adults should do whatever the hell they want in their love lives without government interference. 
       
           That said, Ne-Yo says he's not going to Washington, D.C. to fight for a law change ... 'cause it's not currently affecting his personal life, and he's not sure he wants to marry multiple women. 
       
           We also asked Ne-Yo why he doesn't write songs about dating multiple women ... and, he says it's 'cause he draws on his own life experiences, and this is his first relationship with two women. 
       
           And, we even asked Ne-Yo's GFs if they're interested in walking down the aisle together to marry the star ... and, ya gotta see their reactions to the question. 
       
           Ne-Yo enjoying a polygamous relationship ain't new ... remember, we told you Ne-Yo was spotted down in Miami  holding hands with two women  last summer -- after  his divorce  from ex-wife,  Crystal Renay . 
       
           The two split in part because of Ne-Yo's infidelity ... and, it seems a relationship with two women may suit him better than a relationship with just one. 
       
           Anyhoo ... no wedding bells for Ne-Yo in the future -- both by law and by choice!

Kanye & Bianca Out For An Afternoon Drive ... Battery Report No Big Deal,"
           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight."" 
       
           It'd be massive ... but first, Saturday night's super fight! üëä

Al Harrington My 4/20 Advice ... 'Get High As F***!!!',"
           Ex-NBA hooper and current weed entrepreneur  Al Harrington  has some solid advice for any newbies looking to celebrate the 4/20 holiday this year ... telling  TMZ Sports  it's pretty simple -- ""get high as f***!!!"" 
       
           Harrington knows his stuff -- the guy built an entire company around his love for Mary Jane ... serving as the CEO of the Viola brand. 
       
           He's doing pretty well for himself, too ... with the company valued at over $100 million. 
       
           Harrington -- who played 16 seasons in the league for a number of teams -- told us he'll be in NYC for a three-day ""4/20 Tour"" this weekend ... 'cause apparently, the dude needs way more than 24 hours to show his love for cannabis. 
       
           Harrington has been a huge advocate for the benefits of marijuana -- in 2017, he sat down with former NBA commish  David Stern  ... and the conversation helped the league eventually take weed off the banned substances list. 
       
           As for folks looking to dabble with some doobies, Harrington says there's no need to complicate it ... just puff, puff, pass and enjoy yourself.

O.J. SIMPSON BANK OF AMERICA CREDIT CARD Up for AUCTION,"
           O.J. Simpson 's Bank of America credit card has hit the auction block ... and let's just say the seller is banking on it raking in some serious cash. 
       
           Jonathan Lepore  is selling the business account card over at  Goldin Auctions  ... telling TMZ he snagged the piece of plastic, which expired in 2023, on eBay last summer for a steal at $70, adding it to his trove of sports memorabilia. 
       
           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

Taylor Swift Smooches Travis Kelce In 'Fortnight' Vid,"
           Taylor Swift  can't hide she's totally smitten with BF  Travis Kelce  in her new YouTube promotional clip for her first music video, ""Fortnight,"" off her recently released 11th album. 
       
           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment. 
       
           But Taylor's not giving any love to her ex  Joe Alwyn  on her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" which was officially released Friday. 
       
           In one song, ""So Long London,"" Taylor  rips into Alwyn  for his alleged depression, which she seemingly attributes to their break-up. 
       
           Taylor also took a major shot at  Kim Kardashian  in another tune, 'thanK you aIMee,""  comparing the reality star to a schoolyard bully  and reigniting their feud from years ago.

           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad. 
       
           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry. 
       
           ""I would love to go ahead and make my own impact,"" he said. 
       
           As for off the field, Brenden doesn't mind being like pops there ... because he just teamed up with Breathe Right to recreate the famous ""Air Jerry"" ad that the elder Rice was a part of in his heyday.

           But, he said he's down to play anywhere ... just as long as they give him a shot to ""create my own legacy and my own name.""

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers. 
       
           In 2016, Jenkins tried to latch on with the Cardinals, but he got injured in the preseason ... and never played another down in the NFL again.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

           Arnold and Sly sat down with  Harvey  for a candid, sometimes stunning convo about the intense rivalry between the 2 mega-action stars. 
       
           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

'90 Day Fianc√©' Liz Slams 'Weakling' Big Ed For Calling Off Wedding!!!,"
           Big Ed Brown  and  Liz Woods  have called it quits again ... and it seems to be for real this time. 
       
           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months. 
       
           Good luck to 'em both ... but we'll miss the drama.

"Busta Rhymes Phones Down, and Put Ya Hands Where My Eyes Can See!!!","
           Busta Rhymes  ain't about to stomach Hollywood-type crowds at his performance -- even if the gig happens to be in the Hollywood Hills!!! 
       
           That was the plotline when  Dwyane Wade  and cannabis co. Jeeter recruited Bussa Bus to perform at the after-party of their 420 ""High Dining"" event ... and while he was trying to do his duty, he wasn't getting high vibes from the crowd. 
       
           Basically, the audience wasn't giving Busta the energy he felt his classic tune ""Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See"" deserved -- so, he cut the music and told the onlookers to get their minds right. 
       
           Busta says he, along with  Spliff Star  and  DJ Scratchator , have been ripping mics since childhood, and he'll be damned if anyone doesn't respect his hip hop hierarchy!!! 
       
           The audience woke up for take 2, and Busta wooed the fans before getting a surprise of his own -- Team Jeeter crafted a new cannabis strain in Busta's honor, adding him to the family alongside D. Wade.

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

"Kanye West Jumping Into Rap Beef ... Drops Drake, J. Cole Diss","
           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"
           4:37 PM PT --  Bam Margera  just posted video to Instagram showing a portion of the attempts he says he made to call 911 for police assistance last week ... recorded before he ended up taking matters into his own hands, fighting off a threatening stranger. 
       
           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. 
       
           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam.

           We just had  Tour√©  on ""TMZ Live"" ... and he doesn't think Drake's diss  has the quality to move units  or butts on the dance floor.

           TMZ Hip Hop caught up with the ""Right Thurr"" rapper ahead of the debut of his ""Unsung"" episode on TV One. He's on his ""Nu Beginnings"" wave courtesy of his brand-new single released today, but still has a sour taste in his mouth over the  Sidney Starr  situation  he says  killed his career climb. 
       
           Chingy recalls being blackballed when Sidney, a transgender model, lied about sleeping with him back in the day, and tells us her eventual apology barely did any real damage control. 
       
           The St. Louis rapper came out the gate with a multi-platinum debut in 2003, and put many bullets on the Billboard charts. 
       
           However, he says he saw, firsthand, how easily fans can forget about you when the mainstream machine isn't pumping your product. 
       
           Speaking of the mainstream, Chingy also fears  Drake  and  Kendrick Lamar 's  current clash  is getting way too intense ... and the back-and-forth stingers could escalate to violence if they're not careful. 
       
           Rap hasn't been keeping the peace as of late, but Chingy feels it can be done.

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities.

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"

           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage.

           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

LUKE BRYAN MEATy Backside Broke My Fall üçëüôèüèΩ,"
           Luke Bryan 's counting his blessings for the extra padding that saved him when he took a nasty tumble onstage during his latest concert stop. 
       
           We caught up with the country star at Cecconi's Monday in L.A. ... and he joked his weekend slip-and-fall wasn't as painful as it looked 'cause he's got ""a whole lot of meat back there"" -- referring to his butt, of course -- which softened the landing. 
       
           ICYMI, the initial buzz was Luke  went horizontal  Saturday -- during his performance at the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver -- due to a fan's phone that was left on the stage. 
       
           But, a later video angle showed he simply slipped on the floor ... perhaps on some moisture or liquid. Either way, Luke's told us he's still scratching his head over what exactly sent him plummeting. 
       
           He clearly didn't mind being the butt of the joke, though, as he spoke to us -- and also by the way he reacted with good humor seconds after going down. 
       
           In the viral clip of his fall, you can see Luke staying down for a hot second ... before brushing it off with a laugh as he jumped back up 'cause the show must go on, of course!

Jill Scott Blown Up for Chris Brown Defense ... After His Quavo Attack,"
           Jill Scott  isn't going to let  Chris Brown ‚Äôs checkered past block her enjoyment of listening to him lyrically pummel  Quavo , and she's been fending off critics who wished she didn't cape for Chris!!! 
       
           The ripple effect from Chris' brutal ""Weakest Link"" graced Jill's radar over the weekend and she couldn't help, but gush over the embattled singer's MC skills ... ‚Äú@chrisbrown is amazing. How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap‚Ä¶ like THAT?‚Äù wrote Scott on Sunday morning. 
       
           ‚ÄúBeyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional üî•. There‚Äôs nothing to debate.‚Äù 
       
           The praise struck a nerve with fans on X, many felt CB had gone too far on the diss -- especially with his record of domestic violence with  Rihanna . 
       
           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments. 
       
           Despite the backlash, people are enjoying CB's spill --. the song has nearly 2 million plays on his YouTube channel, and would inevitably rack up more if he put the song on streaming. 
       
           Quavo is currently on the clock.

           The comedian acknowledged using the lord to troll us -- we don't mind, Duval, it's still good content. Maybe the City Girls have a prayer of coming back now!!! 
       
           All jokes aside, it was great to see Duval up and at 'em -- he's fully recovered from the  gnarly 2022 car wreck  that forced him to get airlifted from the Bahamas for medical treatment. 
       
           He only uses his singing voice outdoors, apparently, because he had plenty of banter when he went on ""The Breakfast Club.""

           Breakout New York City rapper  Sugarhill Ddot  has collected millions of streams for his music at just 16 years old but the hip hop landscape is changing ... all the top guys are beefing!!! 
       
           Ddot tells TMZ Hip Hop seeing  Drake   vs.  Kendrick Lamar  vs.  Rick Ross , etc. isn't the game he thought he signed up for ... their antics taught him to avoid that route when it comes to his generation. 
       
           He's one of the handful of youngins revamping the NYC Drill sound for a new era, carrying on the tradition started by Sugarhill Gang's iconic record ""Rapper's Delight"" decades before he was born.

David Beckham Sues Mark Wahlberg's Co. ... You're Unfit to Make Fitness Deals!!!,"
           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyonc√© Fans,"
           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

Delta Burke I Tried Crystal Meth to Lose Lbs. ... Didn't Eat for 5 Days!!!,"
           Delta Burke  is revealing the shocking lengths to which she went just to drop a few pounds in her heyday -- using crystal meth as an appetite suppressant! 
       
           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days."" 
       
           Despite her attempts to lose weight, Delta recalled still being criticized for her body, which greatly impacted her mental health ... and even led to her early exit from 'DW.' 
       
           While Delta's admission might seem shocking, she isn't the first celeb to seek drug assistance in order to achieve a body transformation. 
       
           The difference is ... now A-listers get those drugs prescribed, as more and more openly turn to weight-loss meds like Wegovy and Ozempic. 
       
           Oprah ,  Amy Schumer ,  Tracy Morgan ,  Sharon Osbourne  and  Chelsea Handler  have all admitted to  using weight-loss drugs .

           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. 
       
           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. 
       
           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. 
       
           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. 
       
           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries.

But, now he's testifying to being a one-woman man, and seems to believe Ne-Yo will eventually narrow down his options too.

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"

           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc√©, and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience."" 
       
           Ashanti is finally confirming what we've suspected for months now ... she and Nelly are indeed expecting a child together! 
       
           On Wednesday, Ashanti posted a comedy skit on Instagram, which showed her momager  Tina Douglas  rushing her to the stage ahead of a concert at Barclays Center. 
       
           When Tina asked how much time she needed to get ready, Ashanti coyly replied ""9 months"" ... and also captioned the post ""Baby, baby, baby, baby"" and clearly wasn't referencing her 2002 hit!!! 
       
           It was Nelly who first tipped off fans -- way  back in December  -- when he gleefully kept rubbing on Ashanti's belly. It wasn't hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they've made it official. 
       
           The family news has been a long time coming -- the couple initially started dating in 2003!!! 
       
           We got soon-to-be uncle  Ja Rule  to give Ashanti and Nelly  some parenting advice  not too long ago. Doing his best Hallmark card impression, Ja told us the main ingredient for a healthy family recipe is love.

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend. 
       
           As they say, out with the old, in with the new -- even for an Ellwood classic.

CELINE DION GIVES RARE INSIGHT INTO LIFE WITH STIFF-PERSON SYNDROME,"
           Celine Dion  says she's doing all she can to prove nothing can hold her back, even as she copes with Stiff-Person Syndrome ... 2 years on from when she was first diagnosed. 
       
           The icon admits she's upset she hasn't conquered the disease yet -- but, as she provided a rare update about her health to  Vogue France , she insisted she was doing everything in her power to push forward in hopes science will eventually find a cure. 
       
           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery. 
       
           The legend's taking things one day at a time, but she's got her sights set on some big goals ... such as seeing the Eiffel Tower again and hitting the road for another tour. 
       
           Celine empoweringly added, ""There's one thing that will never stop, and that's the will. It's the passion. It's the dream. It's the determination."" 
       
           The ""My Heart Will Go On"" singer was  diagnosed with SPS  in 2022, and her sister previously revealed the autoimmune disorder, at times,  leaves Celine completely immobilized . 
       
           But Celine's managed to power through, making some appearances at  NHL games  and also  the Grammys , where she presented  Taylor Swift  with her  Album of the Year award .

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"
           10:16 PM PT  -- A rep for  Kanye West  tells TMZ ... ""'Grabbed' is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted."" 
       
           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

"Kodak Black I'm Off the Hook!!! Drug, Tampering Charges Dismissed","
           Kodak Black  can now place his recent drug possession case in his rearview mirror ... the last significant charge in the case was tossed out this week!!! 
       
           Court docs obtained by TMZ Hip Hop show a judge just dismissed the remaining tampering charge against the Florida rapper -- this after previously tossing the drug possession charges, back in February, after Kodak showed he had a prescription for the drugs. 
       
           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them. 
       
           His new single, ""Stressed Out,"" is probably a fitting description of his mood prior to getting the good news.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           The rapper got brutally honest on a new episode of  LeBron James ' show 'The Shop' -- where he basically said that he's frustrated he hasn't won a coveted statuette in his career ... despite having been nominated a whopping ten times already. 
       
           TS says he knows a lot of people in the music biz -- including  Drake ,  The Weeknd  and others -- have  thrown up two middle fingers  at the Recording Academy ... but he isn't there yet. 
       
           Travis notes that a pro in any industry -- especially competitive ones, like sports -- is in it to win it ... and he says he's no different, explaining that being recognized for his work and honored among his peers is important to him. 
       
           He goes on to say that the prestige that Grammys have historically held still carries weight in his mind -- which is why he says it sucks to get strung along for so many years without a prize, especially when you get booked to perform -- like he has many, many times. 
       
           As we reported ... Travis seemed to  throw a fit  at this year's Grammy Awards when he was snubbed once again -- lashing out on stage and breaking a lot of the stage props for his performance.

           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand.""

           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight."" 
       
           It'd be massive ... but first, Saturday night's super fight! üëä

Dutch Soccer Final Fire Breaks Out Behind Goal ... Game Delayed 30 Minutes,"
           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

Al Harrington My 4/20 Advice ... 'Get High As F***!!!',"
           Ex-NBA hooper and current weed entrepreneur  Al Harrington  has some solid advice for any newbies looking to celebrate the 4/20 holiday this year ... telling  TMZ Sports  it's pretty simple -- ""get high as f***!!!"" 
       
           Harrington knows his stuff -- the guy built an entire company around his love for Mary Jane ... serving as the CEO of the Viola brand. 
       
           He's doing pretty well for himself, too ... with the company valued at over $100 million. 
       
           Harrington -- who played 16 seasons in the league for a number of teams -- told us he'll be in NYC for a three-day ""4/20 Tour"" this weekend ... 'cause apparently, the dude needs way more than 24 hours to show his love for cannabis. 
       
           Harrington has been a huge advocate for the benefits of marijuana -- in 2017, he sat down with former NBA commish  David Stern  ... and the conversation helped the league eventually take weed off the banned substances list. 
       
           As for folks looking to dabble with some doobies, Harrington says there's no need to complicate it ... just puff, puff, pass and enjoy yourself.

O.J. SIMPSON BANK OF AMERICA CREDIT CARD Up for AUCTION,"
           O.J. Simpson 's Bank of America credit card has hit the auction block ... and let's just say the seller is banking on it raking in some serious cash. 
       
           Jonathan Lepore  is selling the business account card over at  Goldin Auctions  ... telling TMZ he snagged the piece of plastic, which expired in 2023, on eBay last summer for a steal at $70, adding it to his trove of sports memorabilia. 
       
           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

Taylor Swift Smooches Travis Kelce In 'Fortnight' Vid,"
           Taylor Swift  can't hide she's totally smitten with BF  Travis Kelce  in her new YouTube promotional clip for her first music video, ""Fortnight,"" off her recently released 11th album. 
       
           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment. 
       
           But Taylor's not giving any love to her ex  Joe Alwyn  on her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" which was officially released Friday. 
       
           In one song, ""So Long London,"" Taylor  rips into Alwyn  for his alleged depression, which she seemingly attributes to their break-up. 
       
           Taylor also took a major shot at  Kim Kardashian  in another tune, 'thanK you aIMee,""  comparing the reality star to a schoolyard bully  and reigniting their feud from years ago.

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

Brenden Rice Jerry's Son Won't Wear No. 80 In NFL ... Determined To Create Own Legacy,"
           Another Rice is making his way to the NFL this season ... but don't expect him to look anything like  Jerry  on gamedays -- no,  Brenden Rice  tells  TMZ Sports  he's gunning to be his own man when it comes time to perform on Sundays. 
       
           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad. 
       
           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry. 
       
           ""I would love to go ahead and make my own impact,"" he said. 
       
           As for off the field, Brenden doesn't mind being like pops there ... because he just teamed up with Breathe Right to recreate the famous ""Air Jerry"" ad that the elder Rice was a part of in his heyday. 
       
           Brenden took pics with the nasal strip to emulate his pops for the company -- and he told us he was stoked to get to wear the product while on the gridiron ... just like Jerry. 
       
           As for where Brenden will be seen next in the strips ... he said he's been hearing a lot from the Chargers, Cardinals, Buccaneers, Eagles, and Jets. 
       
           But, he said he's down to play anywhere ... just as long as they give him a shot to ""create my own legacy and my own name.""

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers. 
       
           In 2016, Jenkins tried to latch on with the Cardinals, but he got injured in the preseason ... and never played another down in the NFL again.

Arnold Schwarzenegger Here's How I Punked Sly Into Starring in Movie Flop!!!,"
           Arnold Schwarzenegger  epically punked  Sylvester Stallone  into signing on for the most disastrous film of Sly's career, and that's exactly what Arnold wanted to happen! 
       
           Arnold and Sly sat down with  Harvey  for a candid, sometimes stunning convo about the intense rivalry between the 2 mega-action stars. 
       
           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

           The tenured music and cultural critic hopped on ""TMZ Live"" on Thursday and pinpointed what he feels are dings in Drake's armor ... mainly his comeback response, which Tour√© isn't all that impressed with. 
       
           Drake has been owning up to his ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" track ... using the lyrics to tease both  Metro Boomin  and Kendrick's manager on social media ... but Tour√© feels sneaky tactics pale in comparison to the points K. Dot has already put on the board. 
       
           Remember, Kendrick's feature on  Future  and Metro's  ""Like That"" record  has been No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 3 straight weeks now and Tour√© is daring any DJ to try and drop ""Push Ups"" in the club ... he says the song will bomb!!! 
       
           Tour√© says Kendrick and everyone else is well within their rights to fire back at Drake after years of sneak disses ... and he's strongly against giving Drake a handicap for not showing signs of obliteration. 
       
           It's an interesting viewpoint ... especially since Drake claimed it was Kendrick who gets the benefit of the doubt over him. 
       
           At any rate, Tour√©'s convinced a Kendrick nuke is coming. His backers are speaking similar code.

           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes.

           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise.

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden . 
       
           It's hard not to remember the break-in at  Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco home back in 2022 ... when her husband  Paul Pelosi  was  bludgeoned with a hammer  by  David DePape . 
       
           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect."" 
       
           We're told LAPD's elite Robbery and Homicide division is investigating the case.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

"Spring Breakers Can't Stop Brawlin', Trash the Ocean","
           Spring Break reached rowdy new heights outside Savannah, GA ... as several violent fights broke out, despite increased police presence. 
       
           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well."" 
       
           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down.

NASCAR Massive Crash At Talladega ... Tyler Reddick Ends Up Winning,"
           A brutal crash went down in the closing moments of NASCAR's Geico 500 at Talladega on Sunday ... taking out several cars in the final lap and paving the way for  Tyler Reddick  to come away with the win. 
       
           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega. 
       
           Michael Jordan  was proud of his driver's crazy win ... and celebrated with his family, including Reddick's son.

'90 Day Fianc√©' Liz Slams 'Weakling' Big Ed For Calling Off Wedding!!!,"
           Big Ed Brown  and  Liz Woods  have called it quits again ... and it seems to be for real this time. 
       
           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months.

Jake Plummer Down For Pat Tillman HOF Honor ... But I Know His Legacy Will Go On Regardless,"

           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too. 
       
           ""I think about him a lot,"" Jake said, ""and I know he's inspiring a lot of people to be better.""

           Sly and  Arnold Schwarzenegger  sat down with  Harvey , and for the first time ever together they talked about their unbelievable rivalry and how it blossomed into a close friendship. 
       
           Arnold's trainer and compadre, bodybuilding legend  Franco Columbu , trained Sly for ""Rocky II,"" and when Franco challenged Sly to a bench press competition, the actor was game ... until he ripped his pec off the bone. 
       
           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury.

           83-year-old Rose also signed ... ""I WISH I HAD AN INTERPRETER"" 
       
           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it.

Comedian Elayne Boosler I Was Arrested At Dodger Game ... All 'Cause Of My Bag?!?,"
           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"
           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in '63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn't going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. 
       
           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

           Some NBA hoopers think  Rudy Gobert   is the most overrated player in the league ... but his partner,  Julia Bonilla , says those guys are dead wrong -- passionately defending the Minnesota Timberwolves star on social media. 
       
           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain't all that. 
       
           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man's new title ... and it's safe to say she's pissed, 'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. 
       
           ""My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met,"" Bonilla said. ""He hasn't stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career."" 
       
           ""It's hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense,"" she added. ""I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind."" 
       
           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run. 
       
           ""I am proud of you, and our son is proud of you."" 
       
           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a ""blessing"" to start a family. 
       
           Something Bonilla will certainly like -- Gobert was just named a finalist for the NBA's DPOY once again this season ... and that award actually means something.

BEYONC√â THESE LUSCIOUS LOCkS?! ALL MY OWN! Slams Haters in Tutorial,"
           Beyonc√© 's shutting down the haters and showing she's more than just wigs and extensions ... by embracing her luscious, natural locks while promoting her new natural hair care line. 
       
           The singer dropped her in-depth hair-washing routine on IG Sunday ... embracing her naturally thick, glossy tresses as they were washed, conditioned, blow-dried, and styled using products from her own brand, C√©cred. 
       
           While her stylists worked their magic, Beyonc√© narrated, ""Now that C√©cred is known for the quality in what it does for your hair, I think it's about time I show y'all what it does for my hair."" 
       
           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!"" 
       
           Beyonc√©'s dad,  Mathew Knowles , already stepped up to back his daughter ... telling TMZ she definitely knows a thing or 2 about  keeping hair happy and healthy , considering he and   Tina Knowles  ran a successful salon in Houston for nearly 2 decades. 
       
           And, judging by Bey's hair care routine, looks like her products are totally making waves. Now, will that be enough to silence the hate? Of course not.

Brittany Mahomes Bikini Holds On For Dear Life ... On Yacht W/ Gal Pals,"
           Patrick Mahomes ' wife,  Brittany , really is a bikini model now -- the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit rookie put her stunning body on display during her vacation in Mexico ... and flaunted some serious underboob in the process. 
       
           The Kansas City Chiefs superstar and his longtime partner had a romantic trip in Cabo San Lucas over the past several days ... but on Sunday, it was all about the girls. 
       
           Brittany was spotted on a luxurious yacht with at least four other ladies ... soaking up the sun as they lounged on the back deck. 
       
           Britt rocked a tiny, orange two-piece for the occasion ... which is something she's quite accustomed to lately, as she was named to  SI's newest swimsuit issue  back in February. 
       
           No word on what all the ladies got into ... but chances are they had  Taylor Swift 's new 'Tortured Poets Department' album blaring on the speakers, considering Brittany was  super pumped  for  Travis Kelce 's girlfriend when the project dropped. 
       
           It was quite the eventful trip for the Mahomeses -- as we previously reported, the couple was  heckled by Raiders fans  while out at dinner together last week. 
       
           But all good things come to an end ... and same goes for the trip -- after all, the next football season will be here before ya know it.

T-Pain Victim in ATL Hit-and-Run ... Vows REVENGE!!!,"
           So much for Sunday Funday  ...  T-Pain 's weekend came to a crashing end in Atlanta, when a speeding driver severely rear-ended the Auto-Tune Don's vehicle, and fled the scene without a word!!! 
       
           A calm yet irritated T-Pain went live from the scene of the accident and pointed out a very valuable clue for police ... the driver had left their bumper in the street, and it was only a matter of time before they matched the silver Chevy with the missing part. 
       
           Turns out he was right ... T-Pain posted an update, letting fans know the driver had been caught, and gauging by his use of the üòà emoji, he plans on showing the guy no mercy. 
       
           He says the principle of the driver not stopping to check on their well-being is what got him hot, although it appeared his own personal driver was headed to the hospital for medical attention. 
       
           The crash forced T-Pain to alter his packed itinerary but something tells us he'll make up for it in legal justice.

Matt Ryan Former NFL MVP Retires At 38,"
           Matty Ice is putting his career on ice for good -- former NFL MVP  Matt Ryan  is officially retiring from professional football after 15 seasons. 
       
           The Atlanta Falcons great -- who played all but one season with the organization -- released a heartfelt goodbye to the game on Monday ... saying it was time to hang up the helmet. 
       
           ""Today, 16 years after being drafted, my childhood dream has officially come to an end,"" Ryan said. 
       
           ""I'm honored to retire as a Falcon."" 
       
           Ryan -- the third overall pick in 2008 -- played his best season in 2016 ... leading the league in passer rating and being named first-team All-Pro. 
       
           He threw for nearly 63,000 yards during his time under center ... and had 381 touchdowns and just 183 interceptions. 
       
           Ryan -- the franchise's all-time wins leader for a quarterback -- led the Falcons to a NFC Championship in 2017. 
       
           Ryan shouted out several members of the Falcons organization ... including owner  Arthur Blank  and teammates like  Tony Gonzalez ,  Michael Turner ,  Roddy White  and, of course,  Julio Jones . 
       
           ""I truly believe that football life is not simple about what you do but rather who you do it with and I was a better player because of the people I was surrounded by,"" Ryan added. 
       
           The four-time Pro Bowler played his final season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2022 ... going 4-7-1 in 12 games. 
       
           He spent the 2023 campaign working for CBS on NFL Sundays. 
       
           Congrats on retirement, Matty Ice!!

"Drake My Diss Is Streaming ... Now What, Chumps?!?","
           Drake  officially owned up to his ""Push Ups"" diss track against  Kendrick Lamar ,  Metro Boomin , etc. ... the song is now available on streaming services --  DJ Whoo Kid  tag, copyright stamps and all!!! 
       
           As of Friday, the move puts to bed speculation that the song  was a product of AI , or that Drake was scared to claim it on the charts. 
       
           We just had  Tour√©  on ""TMZ Live"" ... and he doesn't think Drake's diss  has the quality to move units  or butts on the dance floor. 
       
           The upcoming week will be the ultimate test!!! 
       
           Drake recently scoffed at K. Dot's longtime associate,  DJ Hed , after it was suggested Kendrick wasn't in a rush to disrupt the runaway success of his  Drake diss, ""Like That""  ... which has now spent 3 weeks atop Billboard's Hot 100. 
       
           Drake says Hed is being used as a blind spokesperson as Kendrick's team scrambles for answers to ""Push Ups"" -- basically, he thinks the silence is deafening!!! 
       
           Sources close to the situation tell us Kendrick is 100% going to drop ... it's just a matter of when!!!

           That was the plotline when  Dwyane Wade  and cannabis co. Jeeter recruited Bussa Bus to perform at the after-party of their 420 ""High Dining"" event ... and while he was trying to do his duty, he wasn't getting high vibes from the crowd. 
       
           Basically, the audience wasn't giving Busta the energy he felt his classic tune ""Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See"" deserved -- so, he cut the music and told the onlookers to get their minds right. 
       
           Busta says he, along with  Spliff Star  and  DJ Scratchator , have been ripping mics since childhood, and he'll be damned if anyone doesn't respect his hip hop hierarchy!!! 
       
           The audience woke up for take 2, and Busta wooed the fans before getting a surprise of his own -- Team Jeeter crafted a new cannabis strain in Busta's honor, adding him to the family alongside D. Wade.

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

           TMZ Hip Hop caught up with the ""Right Thurr"" rapper ahead of the debut of his ""Unsung"" episode on TV One. He's on his ""Nu Beginnings"" wave courtesy of his brand-new single released today, but still has a sour taste in his mouth over the  Sidney Starr  situation  he says  killed his career climb. 
       
           Chingy recalls being blackballed when Sidney, a transgender model, lied about sleeping with him back in the day, and tells us her eventual apology barely did any real damage control. 
       
           The St. Louis rapper came out the gate with a multi-platinum debut in 2003, and put many bullets on the Billboard charts. 
       
           However, he says he saw, firsthand, how easily fans can forget about you when the mainstream machine isn't pumping your product.

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

           He's one of the handful of youngins revamping the NYC Drill sound for a new era, carrying on the tradition started by Sugarhill Gang's iconic record ""Rapper's Delight"" decades before he was born.

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"

           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"
           9:45 AM PT  --  Kid Cudi  just posted a video update detailing what happened during his jump offstage, ""This is what happens when a 40-year-old man tries to prance around off stage like he's 26."" 
       
           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

           According to Meek, he barely had the whip for 4 hours but witnessed several safety features fail on him, including the airbags ... which he, unfortunately, experienced during the crash!!! 
       
           GMC offered up the typical corporate response and requested Meek send them a DM on X for further info, but Meek might have moved on to other car makers. 
       
           Meek says it was his first non-Tesla electric vehicle and by the sounds of things, he likely won't abandon  Elon Musk 's products again. 
       
           Of course, he might have a similar issue with a Cybertruck, if that's his jam.

Nicki Minaj Almost Nailed by Object ... Hurls it Back Into Crowd!!!,"
           Nicki Minaj  will not stand for objects being thrown at her -- giving one concertgoer a taste of their own medicine. 
       
           Check it out .. during a performance of her hit song ""Starships,"" the rapper swats away an item as it flies toward her face. Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. 
       
           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. 
       
           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows. 
       
           We're not sure why this trend is growing ... but celebs are def over it!!!

T-Pain Victim in ATL Hit-and-Run ... Vows REVENGE!!!,"
           So much for Sunday Funday  ...  T-Pain 's weekend came to a crashing end in Atlanta, when a speeding driver severely rear-ended the Auto-Tune Don's vehicle, and fled the scene without a word!!! 
       
           A calm yet irritated T-Pain went live from the scene of the accident and pointed out a very valuable clue for police ... the driver had left their bumper in the street, and it was only a matter of time before they matched the silver Chevy with the missing part. 
       
           Turns out he was right ... T-Pain posted an update, letting fans know the driver had been caught, and gauging by his use of the üòà emoji, he plans on showing the guy no mercy. 
       
           He says the principle of the driver not stopping to check on their well-being is what got him hot, although it appeared his own personal driver was headed to the hospital for medical attention. 
       
           The crash forced T-Pain to alter his packed itinerary but something tells us he'll make up for it in legal justice.

Jill Scott Blown Up for Chris Brown Defense ... After His Quavo Attack,"
           Jill Scott  isn't going to let  Chris Brown ‚Äôs checkered past block her enjoyment of listening to him lyrically pummel  Quavo , and she's been fending off critics who wished she didn't cape for Chris!!! 
       
           The ripple effect from Chris' brutal ""Weakest Link"" graced Jill's radar over the weekend and she couldn't help, but gush over the embattled singer's MC skills ... ‚Äú@chrisbrown is amazing. How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap‚Ä¶ like THAT?‚Äù wrote Scott on Sunday morning. 
       
           ‚ÄúBeyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional üî•. There‚Äôs nothing to debate.‚Äù 
       
           The praise struck a nerve with fans on X, many felt CB had gone too far on the diss -- especially with his record of domestic violence with  Rihanna . 
       
           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments. 
       
           Despite the backlash, people are enjoying CB's spill --. the song has nearly 2 million plays on his YouTube channel, and would inevitably rack up more if he put the song on streaming.

David Beckham Sues Mark Wahlberg's Co. ... You're Unfit to Make Fitness Deals!!!,"
           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

Jake Plummer Down For Pat Tillman HOF Honor ... But I Know His Legacy Will Go On Regardless,"
           If  Pat Tillman  ever gets honored at the Pro Football Hall of Fame,  Jake Plummer  will be the first one there for the ceremony ... although he tells  TMZ Sports  if it doesn't happen, he knows the hero's legacy will go on regardless. 
       
           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too. 
       
           ""I think about him a lot,"" Jake said, ""and I know he's inspiring a lot of people to be better."" 
       
           We discussed Pat's legacy on a previous episode of  Last Days , available on all podcast platforms.

NASCAR Massive Crash At Talladega ... Tyler Reddick Ends Up Winning,"
           A brutal crash went down in the closing moments of NASCAR's Geico 500 at Talladega on Sunday ... taking out several cars in the final lap and paving the way for  Tyler Reddick  to come away with the win. 
       
           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega. 
       
           Michael Jordan  was proud of his driver's crazy win ... and celebrated with his family, including Reddick's son. 
       
           This is Reddick's sixth Cup Series win of his career ... and given how he earned it, it may be one of the most memorable.

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

           ICYMI, the initial buzz was Luke  went horizontal  Saturday -- during his performance at the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver -- due to a fan's phone that was left on the stage. 
       
           But, a later video angle showed he simply slipped on the floor ... perhaps on some moisture or liquid. Either way, Luke's told us he's still scratching his head over what exactly sent him plummeting. 
       
           He clearly didn't mind being the butt of the joke, though, as he spoke to us -- and also by the way he reacted with good humor seconds after going down.

           Sylvester Stallone  came within a hair's breadth of tanking ""Rocky II"" because of a gruesome injury, and you won't believe how he powered through to shoot the flick! 
       
           Sly and  Arnold Schwarzenegger  sat down with  Harvey , and for the first time ever together they talked about their unbelievable rivalry and how it blossomed into a close friendship. 
       
           Arnold's trainer and compadre, bodybuilding legend  Franco Columbu , trained Sly for ""Rocky II,"" and when Franco challenged Sly to a bench press competition, the actor was game ... until he ripped his pec off the bone. 
       
           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury. 
       
           As Sly put it to us ... pushing through the pain is just what driven folks like Arnold and himself did to make it to the top.

           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

           He threw for nearly 63,000 yards during his time under center ... and had 381 touchdowns and just 183 interceptions.

           ""It's hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense,"" she added. ""I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind."" 
       
           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run.

           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

MINNESOTA CAR CRASH Up in Flames ... Driver Saved by Brave Passersby!!!,"
           A bunch of good Samaritans banded together to save a driver from a burning car at the very last second ... and the harrowing rescue is all on video. 
       
           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. 
       
           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. 
       
           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. 
       
           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. 
       
           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries.

Pete Rose Roasts Ohtani Over Betting Scandal ... At Autoraph Signing,"
           Pete Rose  trolled  Shohei Ohtani  over the weekend, poking fun at the Dodgers superstar at an autograph signing ... all over the  Ippei Mizhuara  betting scandal. 
       
           ""SORRY I BET ON BASEBALL"" and ""OHTANI IS SORRY ALSO"" are two of the phrases the hit king signed at the Fiterman Sports Group signing in St. Paul, Minnesota ... attended by a large group of collectors. 
       
           83-year-old Rose also signed ... ""I WISH I HAD AN INTERPRETER"" 
       
           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it. 
       
           Major League Baseball has pressed pause on their investigation, opting to wait until Mizuhara's criminal case is closed, to determine if they'll investigate Ohtani, or anyone else involved, any further. 
       
           But, you know where Pete stands.

Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyonc√© Fans,"
           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

Ashanti I'm Preggo with Nelly's Baby ... And We're Engaged Too!!!,"
           2:33 PM PT  -- According to  Essence ,  Nelly  and  Ashanti  are also engaged -- so big day for them. 
       
           Ashanti says, ""This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope, and anticipation. Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc√©, and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience."" 
       
           Ashanti is finally confirming what we've suspected for months now ... she and Nelly are indeed expecting a child together! 
       
           On Wednesday, Ashanti posted a comedy skit on Instagram, which showed her momager  Tina Douglas  rushing her to the stage ahead of a concert at Barclays Center. 
       
           When Tina asked how much time she needed to get ready, Ashanti coyly replied ""9 months"" ... and also captioned the post ""Baby, baby, baby, baby"" and clearly wasn't referencing her 2002 hit!!! 
       
           It was Nelly who first tipped off fans -- way  back in December  -- when he gleefully kept rubbing on Ashanti's belly. It wasn't hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they've made it official. 
       
           The family news has been a long time coming -- the couple initially started dating in 2003!!! 
       
           We got soon-to-be uncle  Ja Rule  to give Ashanti and Nelly  some parenting advice  not too long ago. Doing his best Hallmark card impression, Ja told us the main ingredient for a healthy family recipe is love. 
       
           Congratulations to the happy couple! Musical prodigy now uploading.

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"
           10:16 PM PT  -- A rep for  Kanye West  tells TMZ ... ""'Grabbed' is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted."" 
       
           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"

           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

           Travis notes that a pro in any industry -- especially competitive ones, like sports -- is in it to win it ... and he says he's no different, explaining that being recognized for his work and honored among his peers is important to him. 
       
           He goes on to say that the prestige that Grammys have historically held still carries weight in his mind -- which is why he says it sucks to get strung along for so many years without a prize, especially when you get booked to perform -- like he has many, many times. 
       
           As we reported ... Travis seemed to  throw a fit  at this year's Grammy Awards when he was snubbed once again -- lashing out on stage and breaking a lot of the stage props for his performance. 
       
           He was up for Best Rap Album and lost to  Killer Mike  ... who had  his own trouble at the Grammys . But when it comes to chasing the elusive trophy, Travis says he still wants it.

Ice Spice Hops On Viral 'Fisherrr' Remix... üçë Creamy Like Danimals!!!,"
           Ice Spice  has added her flavor to the hottest hip hop joint on TikTok at the moment ...  Cash Cobain  and  Bay Swag 's ""Fisherrr"" hit has been remixed by Miss Munchkin herself!!! 
       
           Akademiks   says he received an anonymous DM on Thursday ... and quickly realized it was Ice's contribution to the viral smash the East Coast has crowned as their newest rap classic. 
       
           The consensus in Ak's comment section and around the web was Ice got busy on the track ... her BX bark blends well on the ""sexy drill"" beat. 
       
           That's the name of the new genre  Cash told TMZ Hip Hop  he was pioneering when he gave us the play-by-play of how the song blew up on TikTok. 
       
           Ice comes through with show-stealing lyrics of her own ... ""And my ass fat 'cause I eat my oats and my vegetables/And my p***y fat, and it's creamy, ooh, just like Danimals.""

"Tour√© Drake Started Battle, Kendrick Will Win War ... Gonna Be Tragic!!!","
           Drake  will be licking his wounds and bowing to King  Kendrick Lamar  ... a shameful sight  Tour√©  says will become Drake's reality after their rap battle is all said and done. 
       
           The tenured music and cultural critic hopped on ""TMZ Live"" on Thursday and pinpointed what he feels are dings in Drake's armor ... mainly his comeback response, which Tour√© isn't all that impressed with. 
       
           Drake has been owning up to his ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" track ... using the lyrics to tease both  Metro Boomin  and Kendrick's manager on social media ... but Tour√© feels sneaky tactics pale in comparison to the points K. Dot has already put on the board. 
       
           Remember, Kendrick's feature on  Future  and Metro's  ""Like That"" record  has been No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 3 straight weeks now and Tour√© is daring any DJ to try and drop ""Push Ups"" in the club ... he says the song will bomb!!! 
       
           Tour√© says Kendrick and everyone else is well within their rights to fire back at Drake after years of sneak disses ... and he's strongly against giving Drake a handicap for not showing signs of obliteration. 
       
           It's an interesting viewpoint ... especially since Drake claimed it was Kendrick who gets the benefit of the doubt over him. 
       
           At any rate, Tour√©'s convinced a Kendrick nuke is coming. His backers are speaking similar code.

"Ne-Yo Let Polygamists Do What They Want ... But, No Marriage For Me","
           Ne-Yo  wants the government to stay out of his love life ... saying he thinks polygamists should be allowed to marry multiple people -- while holding hands with his two partners! 
       
           We caught up with the singer-songwriter at The Grove in Los Angeles Thursday ... and he made his feelings pretty clear ... consenting adults should do whatever the hell they want in their love lives without government interference. 
       
           That said, Ne-Yo says he's not going to Washington, D.C. to fight for a law change ... 'cause it's not currently affecting his personal life, and he's not sure he wants to marry multiple women. 
       
           We also asked Ne-Yo why he doesn't write songs about dating multiple women ... and, he says it's 'cause he draws on his own life experiences, and this is his first relationship with two women. 
       
           And, we even asked Ne-Yo's GFs if they're interested in walking down the aisle together to marry the star ... and, ya gotta see their reactions to the question. 
       
           Ne-Yo enjoying a polygamous relationship ain't new ... remember, we told you Ne-Yo was spotted down in Miami  holding hands with two women  last summer -- after  his divorce  from ex-wife,  Crystal Renay . 
       
           The two split in part because of Ne-Yo's infidelity ... and, it seems a relationship with two women may suit him better than a relationship with just one. 
       
           Anyhoo ... no wedding bells for Ne-Yo in the future -- both by law and by choice!

Kanye & Bianca Out For An Afternoon Drive ... Battery Report No Big Deal,"
           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

Dutch Soccer Final Fire Breaks Out Behind Goal ... Game Delayed 30 Minutes,"
           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden . 
       
           It's hard not to remember the break-in at  Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco home back in 2022 ... when her husband  Paul Pelosi  was  bludgeoned with a hammer  by  David DePape . 
       
           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect."" 
       
           We're told LAPD's elite Robbery and Homicide division is investigating the case.

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight."" 
       
           It'd be massive ... but first, Saturday night's super fight! üëä

           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory.

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"

           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up.

           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry. 
       
           ""I would love to go ahead and make my own impact,"" he said. 
       
           As for off the field, Brenden doesn't mind being like pops there ... because he just teamed up with Breathe Right to recreate the famous ""Air Jerry"" ad that the elder Rice was a part of in his heyday. 
       
           Brenden took pics with the nasal strip to emulate his pops for the company -- and he told us he was stoked to get to wear the product while on the gridiron ... just like Jerry. 
       
           As for where Brenden will be seen next in the strips ... he said he's been hearing a lot from the Chargers, Cardinals, Buccaneers, Eagles, and Jets. 
       
           But, he said he's down to play anywhere ... just as long as they give him a shot to ""create my own legacy and my own name.""

Arnold Schwarzenegger Here's How I Punked Sly Into Starring in Movie Flop!!!,"
           Arnold Schwarzenegger  epically punked  Sylvester Stallone  into signing on for the most disastrous film of Sly's career, and that's exactly what Arnold wanted to happen! 
       
           Arnold and Sly sat down with  Harvey  for a candid, sometimes stunning convo about the intense rivalry between the 2 mega-action stars. 
       
           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played. 
       
           ""TMZ Presents Arnold & Sly: Rivals, Friends, Icons"" airs Tuesday at 8 PM/7 Central on FOX.

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers. 
       
           In 2016, Jenkins tried to latch on with the Cardinals, but he got injured in the preseason ... and never played another down in the NFL again.

Taylor Swift Smooches Travis Kelce In 'Fortnight' Vid,"
           Taylor Swift  can't hide she's totally smitten with BF  Travis Kelce  in her new YouTube promotional clip for her first music video, ""Fortnight,"" off her recently released 11th album. 
       
           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment. 
       
           But Taylor's not giving any love to her ex  Joe Alwyn  on her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" which was officially released Friday. 
       
           In one song, ""So Long London,"" Taylor  rips into Alwyn  for his alleged depression, which she seemingly attributes to their break-up. 
       
           Taylor also took a major shot at  Kim Kardashian  in another tune, 'thanK you aIMee,""  comparing the reality star to a schoolyard bully  and reigniting their feud from years ago.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

"Spring Breakers Can't Stop Brawlin', Trash the Ocean","
           Spring Break reached rowdy new heights outside Savannah, GA ... as several violent fights broke out, despite increased police presence. 
       
           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well.""

           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months. 
       
           Good luck to 'em both ... but we'll miss the drama.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"
           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in '63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn't going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. 
       
           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"
           Kim Kardashian 's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. 
       
           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days."" 
       
           Despite her attempts to lose weight, Delta recalled still being criticized for her body, which greatly impacted her mental health ... and even led to her early exit from 'DW.' 
       
           While Delta's admission might seem shocking, she isn't the first celeb to seek drug assistance in order to achieve a body transformation. 
       
           The difference is ... now A-listers get those drugs prescribed, as more and more openly turn to weight-loss meds like Wegovy and Ozempic. 
       
           Oprah ,  Amy Schumer ,  Tracy Morgan ,  Sharon Osbourne  and  Chelsea Handler  have all admitted to  using weight-loss drugs . 
       
           Hey, beats the hell outta meth!

Brittany Mahomes Bikini Holds On For Dear Life ... On Yacht W/ Gal Pals,"
           Patrick Mahomes ' wife,  Brittany , really is a bikini model now -- the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit rookie put her stunning body on display during her vacation in Mexico ... and flaunted some serious underboob in the process. 
       
           The Kansas City Chiefs superstar and his longtime partner had a romantic trip in Cabo San Lucas over the past several days ... but on Sunday, it was all about the girls. 
       
           Brittany was spotted on a luxurious yacht with at least four other ladies ... soaking up the sun as they lounged on the back deck. 
       
           Britt rocked a tiny, orange two-piece for the occasion ... which is something she's quite accustomed to lately, as she was named to  SI's newest swimsuit issue  back in February. 
       
           No word on what all the ladies got into ... but chances are they had  Taylor Swift 's new 'Tortured Poets Department' album blaring on the speakers, considering Brittany was  super pumped  for  Travis Kelce 's girlfriend when the project dropped. 
       
           It was quite the eventful trip for the Mahomeses -- as we previously reported, the couple was  heckled by Raiders fans  while out at dinner together last week. 
       
           But all good things come to an end ... and same goes for the trip -- after all, the next football season will be here before ya know it.

CELINE DION GIVES RARE INSIGHT INTO LIFE WITH STIFF-PERSON SYNDROME,"
           Celine Dion  says she's doing all she can to prove nothing can hold her back, even as she copes with Stiff-Person Syndrome ... 2 years on from when she was first diagnosed. 
       
           The icon admits she's upset she hasn't conquered the disease yet -- but, as she provided a rare update about her health to  Vogue France , she insisted she was doing everything in her power to push forward in hopes science will eventually find a cure. 
       
           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery. 
       
           The legend's taking things one day at a time, but she's got her sights set on some big goals ... such as seeing the Eiffel Tower again and hitting the road for another tour. 
       
           Celine empoweringly added, ""There's one thing that will never stop, and that's the will. It's the passion. It's the dream. It's the determination."" 
       
           The ""My Heart Will Go On"" singer was  diagnosed with SPS  in 2022, and her sister previously revealed the autoimmune disorder, at times,  leaves Celine completely immobilized . 
       
           But Celine's managed to power through, making some appearances at  NHL games  and also  the Grammys , where she presented  Taylor Swift  with her  Album of the Year award .

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend. 
       
           As they say, out with the old, in with the new -- even for an Ellwood classic.

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"
           4:37 PM PT --  Bam Margera  just posted video to Instagram showing a portion of the attempts he says he made to call 911 for police assistance last week ... recorded before he ended up taking matters into his own hands, fighting off a threatening stranger. 
       
           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. 
       
           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam.

           Beyonc√© 's shutting down the haters and showing she's more than just wigs and extensions ... by embracing her luscious, natural locks while promoting her new natural hair care line. 
       
           The singer dropped her in-depth hair-washing routine on IG Sunday ... embracing her naturally thick, glossy tresses as they were washed, conditioned, blow-dried, and styled using products from her own brand, C√©cred. 
       
           While her stylists worked their magic, Beyonc√© narrated, ""Now that C√©cred is known for the quality in what it does for your hair, I think it's about time I show y'all what it does for my hair."" 
       
           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!"" 
       
           Beyonc√©'s dad,  Mathew Knowles , already stepped up to back his daughter ... telling TMZ she definitely knows a thing or 2 about  keeping hair happy and healthy , considering he and   Tina Knowles  ran a successful salon in Houston for nearly 2 decades. 
       
           And, judging by Bey's hair care routine, looks like her products are totally making waves. Now, will that be enough to silence the hate? Of course not.

"Drake My Diss Is Streaming ... Now What, Chumps?!?","

           As of Friday, the move puts to bed speculation that the song  was a product of AI , or that Drake was scared to claim it on the charts. 
       
           We just had  Tour√©  on ""TMZ Live"" ... and he doesn't think Drake's diss  has the quality to move units  or butts on the dance floor. 
       
           The upcoming week will be the ultimate test!!! 
       
           Drake recently scoffed at K. Dot's longtime associate,  DJ Hed , after it was suggested Kendrick wasn't in a rush to disrupt the runaway success of his  Drake diss, ""Like That""  ... which has now spent 3 weeks atop Billboard's Hot 100.

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"

           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"

           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women.

           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments.

           According to Meek, he barely had the whip for 4 hours but witnessed several safety features fail on him, including the airbags ... which he, unfortunately, experienced during the crash!!! 
       
           GMC offered up the typical corporate response and requested Meek send them a DM on X for further info, but Meek might have moved on to other car makers. 
       
           Meek says it was his first non-Tesla electric vehicle and by the sounds of things, he likely won't abandon  Elon Musk 's products again. 
       
           Of course, he might have a similar issue with a Cybertruck, if that's his jam.

LUKE BRYAN MEATy Backside Broke My Fall üçëüôèüèΩ,"
           Luke Bryan 's counting his blessings for the extra padding that saved him when he took a nasty tumble onstage during his latest concert stop. 
       
           We caught up with the country star at Cecconi's Monday in L.A. ... and he joked his weekend slip-and-fall wasn't as painful as it looked 'cause he's got ""a whole lot of meat back there"" -- referring to his butt, of course -- which softened the landing. 
       
           ICYMI, the initial buzz was Luke  went horizontal  Saturday -- during his performance at the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver -- due to a fan's phone that was left on the stage. 
       
           But, a later video angle showed he simply slipped on the floor ... perhaps on some moisture or liquid. Either way, Luke's told us he's still scratching his head over what exactly sent him plummeting. 
       
           He clearly didn't mind being the butt of the joke, though, as he spoke to us -- and also by the way he reacted with good humor seconds after going down. 
       
           In the viral clip of his fall, you can see Luke staying down for a hot second ... before brushing it off with a laugh as he jumped back up 'cause the show must go on, of course!

Dwyane Wade 'High Dining' For Best Buds ... Gabrielle Makes Magic!!!,"
           Dwyane Wade 's annual ""High Dining"" dinner, in honor of 420, went down with several of the NBA great's famous pals rolling up to join the festivities -- including a few surprises. 
       
           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities. 
       
           His wife  Gabrielle Union  stood in as magician  Kevin Li 's assistant -- thankfully everyone kept their hands to themselves, and no one was sliced and diced on the table. üëÄ 
       
           The event also debuted Jeeter and the  Bob Marley  estate's master collaboration -- a 4.2-gram pre-roll packaged in a guitar case ... in other words, a Jah-endorsed rollout! 
       
           Bob's grandson, Grammy-nominated singer  Skip Marley  also performed ""Jamming"" and ""One Love"" -- and the significance of having the latest generation of Marley hitmakers present needed no explanation.

Nicki Minaj Almost Nailed by Object ... Hurls it Back Into Crowd!!!,"

           Check it out .. during a performance of her hit song ""Starships,"" the rapper swats away an item as it flies toward her face. Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. 
       
           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. 
       
           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows.

"Kanye West Jumping Into Rap Beef ... Drops Drake, J. Cole Diss","
           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

David Beckham Sues Mark Wahlberg's Co. ... You're Unfit to Make Fitness Deals!!!,"
           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

           A calm yet irritated T-Pain went live from the scene of the accident and pointed out a very valuable clue for police ... the driver had left their bumper in the street, and it was only a matter of time before they matched the silver Chevy with the missing part.

           He says the principle of the driver not stopping to check on their well-being is what got him hot, although it appeared his own personal driver was headed to the hospital for medical attention.

           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too.

           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega.

           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege.

           ""Hold on, anybody seen Bill? Where the f*** is Bill at?!"" Broner said. ""Nah, we know where Devin at. Devin probably trying to get his thoughts together and s***. He'll be alright."" 
       
           ""Where the f*** Bill at?! Bill?!"" 
       
           Broner wasn't the only boxer throwing shade at the Haneys ...  Gervonta 'Tank' Davis , the only fighter to beat  Ryan Garcia ,   also trolled Devin and his crew. 
       
           ""Forget Devin.. WHERE BILL AT WHERE DIRT AT!!!!!!!!!"" Davis said on X. ""And what about you d**k riding ass people."" 
       
           ""I‚Äôm still coming to get n***** .. it‚Äôs not over! N***** gotta see me!"" 
       
           And, of course, Garcia -- who was a significant underdog after a bizarre fight camp -- also took shots, too ... saying Haney broke his jaw during the fight. 
       
           Devin said that's fake news ... but,  that loss  on Saturday was all too real. Stay tuned for DH's next move.

Ne-Yo Gets Warning from Carl Thomas ... Throuple Not All It's Cracked Up to Be!!!,"
           Ne-Yo  is happily living his truth as a non-monogamous man -- but his R&B OG  Carl Thomas  is forewarning him that 2 heads aren't always better than one!!! 
       
           The ""Because Of You"" singer was turning heads in L.A. yesterday when TMZ Hip Hop caught him at The Grove with both of his girlfriends -- and, though he told us he's not looking to get hitched anytime soon, he IS  loving the lifestyle !!! 
       
           Carl's a little older than Ne-Yo but added his own 2 cents to the convo after The Shade Room reposted our clip -- he says he once entertained a throuple situation but says time and wisdom changed his ways. 
       
           The singer was once a platinum-selling powerhouse on  Diddy 's Bad Boy Records in the early 2000s, when you gotta imagine he had plenty of options in the female department. But, now he's testifying to being a one-woman man, and seems to believe Ne-Yo will eventually narrow down his options too. 
       
           Ne-Yo's fresh off  a divorce , and told us everyone's situation varies.

Matt Ryan Former NFL MVP Retires At 38,"
           Matty Ice is putting his career on ice for good -- former NFL MVP  Matt Ryan  is officially retiring from professional football after 15 seasons. 
       
           The Atlanta Falcons great -- who played all but one season with the organization -- released a heartfelt goodbye to the game on Monday ... saying it was time to hang up the helmet. 
       
           ""Today, 16 years after being drafted, my childhood dream has officially come to an end,"" Ryan said. 
       
           ""I'm honored to retire as a Falcon."" 
       
           Ryan -- the third overall pick in 2008 -- played his best season in 2016 ... leading the league in passer rating and being named first-team All-Pro. 
       
           He threw for nearly 63,000 yards during his time under center ... and had 381 touchdowns and just 183 interceptions. 
       
           Ryan -- the franchise's all-time wins leader for a quarterback -- led the Falcons to a NFC Championship in 2017. 
       
           Ryan shouted out several members of the Falcons organization ... including owner  Arthur Blank  and teammates like  Tony Gonzalez ,  Michael Turner ,  Roddy White  and, of course,  Julio Jones . 
       
           ""I truly believe that football life is not simple about what you do but rather who you do it with and I was a better player because of the people I was surrounded by,"" Ryan added. 
       
           The four-time Pro Bowler played his final season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2022 ... going 4-7-1 in 12 games. 
       
           He spent the 2023 campaign working for CBS on NFL Sundays. 
       
           Congrats on retirement, Matty Ice!!

Rudy Gobert Partner Defends NBA Star After Vote ... He's Not Overrated To Me!!!,"
           Some NBA hoopers think  Rudy Gobert   is the most overrated player in the league ... but his partner,  Julia Bonilla , says those guys are dead wrong -- passionately defending the Minnesota Timberwolves star on social media. 
       
           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain't all that. 
       
           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man's new title ... and it's safe to say she's pissed, 'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. 
       
           ""My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met,"" Bonilla said. ""He hasn't stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career."" 
       
           ""It's hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense,"" she added. ""I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind."" 
       
           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run. 
       
           ""I am proud of you, and our son is proud of you."" 
       
           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a ""blessing"" to start a family. 
       
           Something Bonilla will certainly like -- Gobert was just named a finalist for the NBA's DPOY once again this season ... and that award actually means something.

MINNESOTA CAR CRASH Up in Flames ... Driver Saved by Brave Passersby!!!,"
           A bunch of good Samaritans banded together to save a driver from a burning car at the very last second ... and the harrowing rescue is all on video. 
       
           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. 
       
           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. 
       
           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. 
       
           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. 
       
           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries.

           Ashanti says, ""This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope, and anticipation. Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc√©, and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience."" 
       
           Ashanti is finally confirming what we've suspected for months now ... she and Nelly are indeed expecting a child together! 
       
           On Wednesday, Ashanti posted a comedy skit on Instagram, which showed her momager  Tina Douglas  rushing her to the stage ahead of a concert at Barclays Center. 
       
           When Tina asked how much time she needed to get ready, Ashanti coyly replied ""9 months"" ... and also captioned the post ""Baby, baby, baby, baby"" and clearly wasn't referencing her 2002 hit!!! 
       
           It was Nelly who first tipped off fans -- way  back in December  -- when he gleefully kept rubbing on Ashanti's belly. It wasn't hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they've made it official. 
       
           The family news has been a long time coming -- the couple initially started dating in 2003!!! 
       
           We got soon-to-be uncle  Ja Rule  to give Ashanti and Nelly  some parenting advice  not too long ago. Doing his best Hallmark card impression, Ja told us the main ingredient for a healthy family recipe is love.

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

           GloRilla  was arrested  in Georgia on Tuesday for suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container, as well as another traffic charge. 
       
           Kay'La  -- who was married to Dame from September 2021 until he  filed for divorce  in October 2023 -- saw the legal trouble as an opportunity to roast the rapper ... this after she said she wanted to be with the Milwaukee Bucks guard. 
       
           ""Free GloLillard,"" Kay'La wrote on a photo of Glo's mugshot on Instagram, adding the hashtag, ""#sisterwifeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"" 
       
           Fans instantly caught on to the shade ... and had plenty to say about the cryptic message. 
       
           ""She mad, hurt, and taking it out on the wrong person,"" a follower commented. 
       
           Others believe Kay'La -- who has three kids with Lillard -- was joking ... with most people feeling she missed the mark. 
       
           Another wrote ... ""Didn‚Äôt he file for a divorce üò©üò© this is cringey af."" 
       
           Glo, nor Dame, has responded ... not surprising given the hooper has an NBA playoff series coming up.

           Court docs obtained by TMZ Hip Hop show a judge just dismissed the remaining tampering charge against the Florida rapper -- this after previously tossing the drug possession charges, back in February, after Kodak showed he had a prescription for the drugs. 
       
           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"
           10:16 PM PT  -- A rep for  Kanye West  tells TMZ ... ""'Grabbed' is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted."" 
       
           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

"Tour√© Drake Started Battle, Kendrick Will Win War ... Gonna Be Tragic!!!","
           Drake  will be licking his wounds and bowing to King  Kendrick Lamar  ... a shameful sight  Tour√©  says will become Drake's reality after their rap battle is all said and done. 
       
           The tenured music and cultural critic hopped on ""TMZ Live"" on Thursday and pinpointed what he feels are dings in Drake's armor ... mainly his comeback response, which Tour√© isn't all that impressed with. 
       
           Drake has been owning up to his ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" track ... using the lyrics to tease both  Metro Boomin  and Kendrick's manager on social media ... but Tour√© feels sneaky tactics pale in comparison to the points K. Dot has already put on the board. 
       
           Remember, Kendrick's feature on  Future  and Metro's  ""Like That"" record  has been No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 3 straight weeks now and Tour√© is daring any DJ to try and drop ""Push Ups"" in the club ... he says the song will bomb!!! 
       
           Tour√© says Kendrick and everyone else is well within their rights to fire back at Drake after years of sneak disses ... and he's strongly against giving Drake a handicap for not showing signs of obliteration. 
       
           It's an interesting viewpoint ... especially since Drake claimed it was Kendrick who gets the benefit of the doubt over him. 
       
           At any rate, Tour√©'s convinced a Kendrick nuke is coming. His backers are speaking similar code.

"Ne-Yo Let Polygamists Do What They Want ... But, No Marriage For Me","
           Ne-Yo  wants the government to stay out of his love life ... saying he thinks polygamists should be allowed to marry multiple people -- while holding hands with his two partners! 
       
           We caught up with the singer-songwriter at The Grove in Los Angeles Thursday ... and he made his feelings pretty clear ... consenting adults should do whatever the hell they want in their love lives without government interference. 
       
           That said, Ne-Yo says he's not going to Washington, D.C. to fight for a law change ... 'cause it's not currently affecting his personal life, and he's not sure he wants to marry multiple women. 
       
           We also asked Ne-Yo why he doesn't write songs about dating multiple women ... and, he says it's 'cause he draws on his own life experiences, and this is his first relationship with two women. 
       
           And, we even asked Ne-Yo's GFs if they're interested in walking down the aisle together to marry the star ... and, ya gotta see their reactions to the question. 
       
           Ne-Yo enjoying a polygamous relationship ain't new ... remember, we told you Ne-Yo was spotted down in Miami  holding hands with two women  last summer -- after  his divorce  from ex-wife,  Crystal Renay . 
       
           The two split in part because of Ne-Yo's infidelity ... and, it seems a relationship with two women may suit him better than a relationship with just one. 
       
           Anyhoo ... no wedding bells for Ne-Yo in the future -- both by law and by choice!

Kanye & Bianca Out For An Afternoon Drive ... Battery Report No Big Deal,"
           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

Delta Burke I Tried Crystal Meth to Lose Lbs. ... Didn't Eat for 5 Days!!!,"
           Delta Burke  is revealing the shocking lengths to which she went just to drop a few pounds in her heyday -- using crystal meth as an appetite suppressant! 
       
           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days."" 
       
           Despite her attempts to lose weight, Delta recalled still being criticized for her body, which greatly impacted her mental health ... and even led to her early exit from 'DW.' 
       
           While Delta's admission might seem shocking, she isn't the first celeb to seek drug assistance in order to achieve a body transformation. 
       
           The difference is ... now A-listers get those drugs prescribed, as more and more openly turn to weight-loss meds like Wegovy and Ozempic. 
       
           Oprah ,  Amy Schumer ,  Tracy Morgan ,  Sharon Osbourne  and  Chelsea Handler  have all admitted to  using weight-loss drugs .

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden . 
       
           It's hard not to remember the break-in at  Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco home back in 2022 ... when her husband  Paul Pelosi  was  bludgeoned with a hammer  by  David DePape . 
       
           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect."" 
       
           We're told LAPD's elite Robbery and Homicide division is investigating the case.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyonc√© Fans,"
           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months. 
       
           Good luck to 'em both ... but we'll miss the drama.

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"
           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in '63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn't going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. 
       
           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

Brittany Mahomes Bikini Holds On For Dear Life ... On Yacht W/ Gal Pals,"
           Patrick Mahomes ' wife,  Brittany , really is a bikini model now -- the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit rookie put her stunning body on display during her vacation in Mexico ... and flaunted some serious underboob in the process. 
       
           The Kansas City Chiefs superstar and his longtime partner had a romantic trip in Cabo San Lucas over the past several days ... but on Sunday, it was all about the girls. 
       
           Brittany was spotted on a luxurious yacht with at least four other ladies ... soaking up the sun as they lounged on the back deck. 
       
           Britt rocked a tiny, orange two-piece for the occasion ... which is something she's quite accustomed to lately, as she was named to  SI's newest swimsuit issue  back in February. 
       
           No word on what all the ladies got into ... but chances are they had  Taylor Swift 's new 'Tortured Poets Department' album blaring on the speakers, considering Brittany was  super pumped  for  Travis Kelce 's girlfriend when the project dropped. 
       
           It was quite the eventful trip for the Mahomeses -- as we previously reported, the couple was  heckled by Raiders fans  while out at dinner together last week. 
       
           But all good things come to an end ... and same goes for the trip -- after all, the next football season will be here before ya know it.

CELINE DION GIVES RARE INSIGHT INTO LIFE WITH STIFF-PERSON SYNDROME,"
           Celine Dion  says she's doing all she can to prove nothing can hold her back, even as she copes with Stiff-Person Syndrome ... 2 years on from when she was first diagnosed. 
       
           The icon admits she's upset she hasn't conquered the disease yet -- but, as she provided a rare update about her health to  Vogue France , she insisted she was doing everything in her power to push forward in hopes science will eventually find a cure. 
       
           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery. 
       
           The legend's taking things one day at a time, but she's got her sights set on some big goals ... such as seeing the Eiffel Tower again and hitting the road for another tour. 
       
           Celine empoweringly added, ""There's one thing that will never stop, and that's the will. It's the passion. It's the dream. It's the determination."" 
       
           The ""My Heart Will Go On"" singer was  diagnosed with SPS  in 2022, and her sister previously revealed the autoimmune disorder, at times,  leaves Celine completely immobilized . 
       
           But Celine's managed to power through, making some appearances at  NHL games  and also  the Grammys , where she presented  Taylor Swift  with her  Album of the Year award .

"Spring Breakers Can't Stop Brawlin', Trash the Ocean","
           Spring Break reached rowdy new heights outside Savannah, GA ... as several violent fights broke out, despite increased police presence. 
       
           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well."" 
       
           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down.

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend. 
       
           As they say, out with the old, in with the new -- even for an Ellwood classic.

Dutch Soccer Final Fire Breaks Out Behind Goal ... Game Delayed 30 Minutes,"
           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"
           4:37 PM PT --  Bam Margera  just posted video to Instagram showing a portion of the attempts he says he made to call 911 for police assistance last week ... recorded before he ended up taking matters into his own hands, fighting off a threatening stranger. 
       
           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. 
       
           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam.

           The singer dropped her in-depth hair-washing routine on IG Sunday ... embracing her naturally thick, glossy tresses as they were washed, conditioned, blow-dried, and styled using products from her own brand, C√©cred. 
       
           While her stylists worked their magic, Beyonc√© narrated, ""Now that C√©cred is known for the quality in what it does for your hair, I think it's about time I show y'all what it does for my hair."" 
       
           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!""

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight.""

           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction.""

           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment.

           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

           Of course, Posh herself was there though it seemed she shied away from the camera a bit ... focusing on her guests and hangin' firmly with 12-year-old  Harper  all night.  She's still using crutches  BTW ... after breaking her foot in a gym accident. 
       
           BTW ... all the Beckham kids made it out for their mom's bday -- with her boys  Brooklyn ,  Romeo  and  Cruz  pulling up as one big squad and husband  David Beckham  also attending.

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers. 
       
           In 2016, Jenkins tried to latch on with the Cardinals, but he got injured in the preseason ... and never played another down in the NFL again.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

Arnold Schwarzenegger Here's How I Punked Sly Into Starring in Movie Flop!!!,"
           Arnold Schwarzenegger  epically punked  Sylvester Stallone  into signing on for the most disastrous film of Sly's career, and that's exactly what Arnold wanted to happen! 
       
           Arnold and Sly sat down with  Harvey  for a candid, sometimes stunning convo about the intense rivalry between the 2 mega-action stars. 
       
           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

Brenden Rice Jerry's Son Won't Wear No. 80 In NFL ... Determined To Create Own Legacy,"
           Another Rice is making his way to the NFL this season ... but don't expect him to look anything like  Jerry  on gamedays -- no,  Brenden Rice  tells  TMZ Sports  he's gunning to be his own man when it comes time to perform on Sundays. 
       
           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad. 
       
           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry. 
       
           ""I would love to go ahead and make my own impact,"" he said. 
       
           As for off the field, Brenden doesn't mind being like pops there ... because he just teamed up with Breathe Right to recreate the famous ""Air Jerry"" ad that the elder Rice was a part of in his heyday. 
       
           Brenden took pics with the nasal strip to emulate his pops for the company -- and he told us he was stoked to get to wear the product while on the gridiron ... just like Jerry. 
       
           As for where Brenden will be seen next in the strips ... he said he's been hearing a lot from the Chargers, Cardinals, Buccaneers, Eagles, and Jets. 
       
           But, he said he's down to play anywhere ... just as long as they give him a shot to ""create my own legacy and my own name.""

           We caught up with the country star at Cecconi's Monday in L.A. ... and he joked his weekend slip-and-fall wasn't as painful as it looked 'cause he's got ""a whole lot of meat back there"" -- referring to his butt, of course -- which softened the landing. 
       
           ICYMI, the initial buzz was Luke  went horizontal  Saturday -- during his performance at the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver -- due to a fan's phone that was left on the stage. 
       
           But, a later video angle showed he simply slipped on the floor ... perhaps on some moisture or liquid. Either way, Luke's told us he's still scratching his head over what exactly sent him plummeting. 
       
           He clearly didn't mind being the butt of the joke, though, as he spoke to us -- and also by the way he reacted with good humor seconds after going down. 
       
           In the viral clip of his fall, you can see Luke staying down for a hot second ... before brushing it off with a laugh as he jumped back up 'cause the show must go on, of course!

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama.

           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot.

           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

"Drake My Diss Is Streaming ... Now What, Chumps?!?","
           Drake  officially owned up to his ""Push Ups"" diss track against  Kendrick Lamar ,  Metro Boomin , etc. ... the song is now available on streaming services --  DJ Whoo Kid  tag, copyright stamps and all!!! 
       
           As of Friday, the move puts to bed speculation that the song  was a product of AI , or that Drake was scared to claim it on the charts. 
       
           We just had  Tour√©  on ""TMZ Live"" ... and he doesn't think Drake's diss  has the quality to move units  or butts on the dance floor. 
       
           The upcoming week will be the ultimate test!!! 
       
           Drake recently scoffed at K. Dot's longtime associate,  DJ Hed , after it was suggested Kendrick wasn't in a rush to disrupt the runaway success of his  Drake diss, ""Like That""  ... which has now spent 3 weeks atop Billboard's Hot 100. 
       
           Drake says Hed is being used as a blind spokesperson as Kendrick's team scrambles for answers to ""Push Ups"" -- basically, he thinks the silence is deafening!!! 
       
           Sources close to the situation tell us Kendrick is 100% going to drop ... it's just a matter of when!!!

"Kanye West Jumping Into Rap Beef ... Drops Drake, J. Cole Diss","
           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Lil Duval City Girls? I'm 'bout Christianity ... 'God Is On My Side!!!' üé∂üòÜ,"
           Lil Duval  is full 'o puns on Instagram, but he'd much rather speak from a hymn book in real life -- that's his testimony, anyway. 
       
           We caught up with Duval in NYC, and attempted to get his expertise on his homegrown hip hop heroes City Girls -- amid their breakup rumors -- and what we got was an impromptu gospel concert!!! 
       
           The comedian acknowledged using the lord to troll us -- we don't mind, Duval, it's still good content. Maybe the City Girls have a prayer of coming back now!!! 
       
           All jokes aside, it was great to see Duval up and at 'em -- he's fully recovered from the  gnarly 2022 car wreck  that forced him to get airlifted from the Bahamas for medical treatment. 
       
           He only uses his singing voice outdoors, apparently, because he had plenty of banter when he went on ""The Breakfast Club.""

Nicki Minaj Almost Nailed by Object ... Hurls it Back Into Crowd!!!,"
           Nicki Minaj  will not stand for objects being thrown at her -- giving one concertgoer a taste of their own medicine. 
       
           Check it out .. during a performance of her hit song ""Starships,"" the rapper swats away an item as it flies toward her face. Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. 
       
           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. 
       
           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows. 
       
           We're not sure why this trend is growing ... but celebs are def over it!!!

"Chingy Music Industry Full of BS ... Don't Take The Bait, Drake & Kendrick!!!","
           Chingy  is ready for his second wind of music success, but he's wary of the industry -- telling us he's been burned by bad rumors and beef, and doesn't want to see future artists suffer the same fate!!! 
       
           TMZ Hip Hop caught up with the ""Right Thurr"" rapper ahead of the debut of his ""Unsung"" episode on TV One. He's on his ""Nu Beginnings"" wave courtesy of his brand-new single released today, but still has a sour taste in his mouth over the  Sidney Starr  situation  he says  killed his career climb. 
       
           Chingy recalls being blackballed when Sidney, a transgender model, lied about sleeping with him back in the day, and tells us her eventual apology barely did any real damage control. 
       
           The St. Louis rapper came out the gate with a multi-platinum debut in 2003, and put many bullets on the Billboard charts. 
       
           However, he says he saw, firsthand, how easily fans can forget about you when the mainstream machine isn't pumping your product. 
       
           Speaking of the mainstream, Chingy also fears  Drake  and  Kendrick Lamar 's  current clash  is getting way too intense ... and the back-and-forth stingers could escalate to violence if they're not careful. 
       
           Rap hasn't been keeping the peace as of late, but Chingy feels it can be done.

           Back in March, Meek posted a flick of a wrecked GMC but recently revealed how it happened -- he claims the brake pedal fell off, and the car even started driving on him ... while it was in park!!! 
       
           According to Meek, he barely had the whip for 4 hours but witnessed several safety features fail on him, including the airbags ... which he, unfortunately, experienced during the crash!!! 
       
           GMC offered up the typical corporate response and requested Meek send them a DM on X for further info, but Meek might have moved on to other car makers. 
       
           Meek says it was his first non-Tesla electric vehicle and by the sounds of things, he likely won't abandon  Elon Musk 's products again. 
       
           Of course, he might have a similar issue with a Cybertruck, if that's his jam.

           Dwyane Wade 's annual ""High Dining"" dinner, in honor of 420, went down with several of the NBA great's famous pals rolling up to join the festivities -- including a few surprises. 
       
           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities. 
       
           His wife  Gabrielle Union  stood in as magician  Kevin Li 's assistant -- thankfully everyone kept their hands to themselves, and no one was sliced and diced on the table. üëÄ 
       
           The event also debuted Jeeter and the  Bob Marley  estate's master collaboration -- a 4.2-gram pre-roll packaged in a guitar case ... in other words, a Jah-endorsed rollout! 
       
           Bob's grandson, Grammy-nominated singer  Skip Marley  also performed ""Jamming"" and ""One Love"" -- and the significance of having the latest generation of Marley hitmakers present needed no explanation.

           The praise struck a nerve with fans on X, many felt CB had gone too far on the diss -- especially with his record of domestic violence with  Rihanna . 
       
           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments.

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

David Beckham Sues Mark Wahlberg's Co. ... You're Unfit to Make Fitness Deals!!!,"
           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

Jake Plummer Down For Pat Tillman HOF Honor ... But I Know His Legacy Will Go On Regardless,"

           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too. 
       
           ""I think about him a lot,"" Jake said, ""and I know he's inspiring a lot of people to be better.""

           83-year-old Rose also signed ... ""I WISH I HAD AN INTERPRETER"" 
       
           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it.

           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury.

           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run. 
       
           ""I am proud of you, and our son is proud of you."" 
       
           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a ""blessing"" to start a family. 
       
           Something Bonilla will certainly like -- Gobert was just named a finalist for the NBA's DPOY once again this season ... and that award actually means something.

Comedian Elayne Boosler I Was Arrested At Dodger Game ... All 'Cause Of My Bag?!?,"
           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

Matt Ryan Former NFL MVP Retires At 38,"
           Matty Ice is putting his career on ice for good -- former NFL MVP  Matt Ryan  is officially retiring from professional football after 15 seasons. 
       
           The Atlanta Falcons great -- who played all but one season with the organization -- released a heartfelt goodbye to the game on Monday ... saying it was time to hang up the helmet. 
       
           ""Today, 16 years after being drafted, my childhood dream has officially come to an end,"" Ryan said. 
       
           ""I'm honored to retire as a Falcon."" 
       
           Ryan -- the third overall pick in 2008 -- played his best season in 2016 ... leading the league in passer rating and being named first-team All-Pro. 
       
           He threw for nearly 63,000 yards during his time under center ... and had 381 touchdowns and just 183 interceptions. 
       
           Ryan -- the franchise's all-time wins leader for a quarterback -- led the Falcons to a NFC Championship in 2017. 
       
           Ryan shouted out several members of the Falcons organization ... including owner  Arthur Blank  and teammates like  Tony Gonzalez ,  Michael Turner ,  Roddy White  and, of course,  Julio Jones . 
       
           ""I truly believe that football life is not simple about what you do but rather who you do it with and I was a better player because of the people I was surrounded by,"" Ryan added. 
       
           The four-time Pro Bowler played his final season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2022 ... going 4-7-1 in 12 games. 
       
           He spent the 2023 campaign working for CBS on NFL Sundays. 
       
           Congrats on retirement, Matty Ice!!

MINNESOTA CAR CRASH Up in Flames ... Driver Saved by Brave Passersby!!!,"
           A bunch of good Samaritans banded together to save a driver from a burning car at the very last second ... and the harrowing rescue is all on video. 
       
           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. 
       
           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. 
       
           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. 
       
           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. 
       
           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries.

Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyonc√© Fans,"
           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

Delta Burke I Tried Crystal Meth to Lose Lbs. ... Didn't Eat for 5 Days!!!,"
           Delta Burke  is revealing the shocking lengths to which she went just to drop a few pounds in her heyday -- using crystal meth as an appetite suppressant! 
       
           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days."" 
       
           Despite her attempts to lose weight, Delta recalled still being criticized for her body, which greatly impacted her mental health ... and even led to her early exit from 'DW.' 
       
           While Delta's admission might seem shocking, she isn't the first celeb to seek drug assistance in order to achieve a body transformation. 
       
           The difference is ... now A-listers get those drugs prescribed, as more and more openly turn to weight-loss meds like Wegovy and Ozempic. 
       
           Oprah ,  Amy Schumer ,  Tracy Morgan ,  Sharon Osbourne  and  Chelsea Handler  have all admitted to  using weight-loss drugs .

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"
           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in '63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn't going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. 
       
           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"

           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time.

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"

           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.'

           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery.

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend.

BEYONC√â THESE LUSCIOUS LOCkS?! ALL MY OWN! Slams Haters in Tutorial,"
           Beyonc√© 's shutting down the haters and showing she's more than just wigs and extensions ... by embracing her luscious, natural locks while promoting her new natural hair care line. 
       
           The singer dropped her in-depth hair-washing routine on IG Sunday ... embracing her naturally thick, glossy tresses as they were washed, conditioned, blow-dried, and styled using products from her own brand, C√©cred. 
       
           While her stylists worked their magic, Beyonc√© narrated, ""Now that C√©cred is known for the quality in what it does for your hair, I think it's about time I show y'all what it does for my hair."" 
       
           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!"" 
       
           Beyonc√©'s dad,  Mathew Knowles , already stepped up to back his daughter ... telling TMZ she definitely knows a thing or 2 about  keeping hair happy and healthy , considering he and   Tina Knowles  ran a successful salon in Houston for nearly 2 decades. 
       
           And, judging by Bey's hair care routine, looks like her products are totally making waves. Now, will that be enough to silence the hate? Of course not.

Brittany Mahomes Bikini Holds On For Dear Life ... On Yacht W/ Gal Pals,"
           Patrick Mahomes ' wife,  Brittany , really is a bikini model now -- the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit rookie put her stunning body on display during her vacation in Mexico ... and flaunted some serious underboob in the process. 
       
           The Kansas City Chiefs superstar and his longtime partner had a romantic trip in Cabo San Lucas over the past several days ... but on Sunday, it was all about the girls. 
       
           Brittany was spotted on a luxurious yacht with at least four other ladies ... soaking up the sun as they lounged on the back deck. 
       
           Britt rocked a tiny, orange two-piece for the occasion ... which is something she's quite accustomed to lately, as she was named to  SI's newest swimsuit issue  back in February. 
       
           No word on what all the ladies got into ... but chances are they had  Taylor Swift 's new 'Tortured Poets Department' album blaring on the speakers, considering Brittany was  super pumped  for  Travis Kelce 's girlfriend when the project dropped. 
       
           It was quite the eventful trip for the Mahomeses -- as we previously reported, the couple was  heckled by Raiders fans  while out at dinner together last week. 
       
           But all good things come to an end ... and same goes for the trip -- after all, the next football season will be here before ya know it.

Taylor Swift Smooches Travis Kelce In 'Fortnight' Vid,"
           Taylor Swift  can't hide she's totally smitten with BF  Travis Kelce  in her new YouTube promotional clip for her first music video, ""Fortnight,"" off her recently released 11th album. 
       
           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment. 
       
           But Taylor's not giving any love to her ex  Joe Alwyn  on her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" which was officially released Friday. 
       
           In one song, ""So Long London,"" Taylor  rips into Alwyn  for his alleged depression, which she seemingly attributes to their break-up. 
       
           Taylor also took a major shot at  Kim Kardashian  in another tune, 'thanK you aIMee,""  comparing the reality star to a schoolyard bully  and reigniting their feud from years ago.

Dutch Soccer Final Fire Breaks Out Behind Goal ... Game Delayed 30 Minutes,"
           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

O.J. SIMPSON BANK OF AMERICA CREDIT CARD Up for AUCTION,"
           O.J. Simpson 's Bank of America credit card has hit the auction block ... and let's just say the seller is banking on it raking in some serious cash. 
       
           Jonathan Lepore  is selling the business account card over at  Goldin Auctions  ... telling TMZ he snagged the piece of plastic, which expired in 2023, on eBay last summer for a steal at $70, adding it to his trove of sports memorabilia. 
       
           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

Al Harrington My 4/20 Advice ... 'Get High As F***!!!',"
           Ex-NBA hooper and current weed entrepreneur  Al Harrington  has some solid advice for any newbies looking to celebrate the 4/20 holiday this year ... telling  TMZ Sports  it's pretty simple -- ""get high as f***!!!"" 
       
           Harrington knows his stuff -- the guy built an entire company around his love for Mary Jane ... serving as the CEO of the Viola brand. 
       
           He's doing pretty well for himself, too ... with the company valued at over $100 million. 
       
           Harrington -- who played 16 seasons in the league for a number of teams -- told us he'll be in NYC for a three-day ""4/20 Tour"" this weekend ... 'cause apparently, the dude needs way more than 24 hours to show his love for cannabis. 
       
           Harrington has been a huge advocate for the benefits of marijuana -- in 2017, he sat down with former NBA commish  David Stern  ... and the conversation helped the league eventually take weed off the banned substances list. 
       
           As for folks looking to dabble with some doobies, Harrington says there's no need to complicate it ... just puff, puff, pass and enjoy yourself.

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight."" 
       
           It'd be massive ... but first, Saturday night's super fight! üëä

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers.

           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad. 
       
           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

Ne-Yo Gets Warning from Carl Thomas ... Throuple Not All It's Cracked Up to Be!!!,"
           Ne-Yo  is happily living his truth as a non-monogamous man -- but his R&B OG  Carl Thomas  is forewarning him that 2 heads aren't always better than one!!! 
       
           The ""Because Of You"" singer was turning heads in L.A. yesterday when TMZ Hip Hop caught him at The Grove with both of his girlfriends -- and, though he told us he's not looking to get hitched anytime soon, he IS  loving the lifestyle !!! 
       
           Carl's a little older than Ne-Yo but added his own 2 cents to the convo after The Shade Room reposted our clip -- he says he once entertained a throuple situation but says time and wisdom changed his ways. 
       
           The singer was once a platinum-selling powerhouse on  Diddy 's Bad Boy Records in the early 2000s, when you gotta imagine he had plenty of options in the female department. But, now he's testifying to being a one-woman man, and seems to believe Ne-Yo will eventually narrow down his options too. 
       
           Ne-Yo's fresh off  a divorce , and told us everyone's situation varies.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

"Spring Breakers Can't Stop Brawlin', Trash the Ocean","
           Spring Break reached rowdy new heights outside Savannah, GA ... as several violent fights broke out, despite increased police presence. 
       
           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well.""

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"
           10:16 PM PT  -- A rep for  Kanye West  tells TMZ ... ""'Grabbed' is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted."" 
       
           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden .

           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect.""

'90 Day Fianc√©' Liz Slams 'Weakling' Big Ed For Calling Off Wedding!!!,"
           Big Ed Brown  and  Liz Woods  have called it quits again ... and it seems to be for real this time. 
       
           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months.

           When Tina asked how much time she needed to get ready, Ashanti coyly replied ""9 months"" ... and also captioned the post ""Baby, baby, baby, baby"" and clearly wasn't referencing her 2002 hit!!! 
       
           It was Nelly who first tipped off fans -- way  back in December  -- when he gleefully kept rubbing on Ashanti's belly. It wasn't hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they've made it official.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures.""

           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

Drake Trollin' Kendrick's Manager ... Where Is This Supposed Smoke?!?,"
           Drake  has turned his scope away from  Metro Boomin  and  Rick Ross , and returned it to the main event ...  Kendrick Lamar !!! 
       
           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily. 
       
           Nonetheless ... Kendrick's West Coast peeps are confident he'll prevail in the end. üëÄ

"Travis Scott I'll Be Honest, Grammys Matter ... And I Wanna Win One!!!","
           Travis Scott  says while many of his contemporaries have turned their back on the Grammys -- he's still holding out hope he can snag one ... 'cause he still finds they hold value. 
       
           The rapper got brutally honest on a new episode of  LeBron James ' show 'The Shop' -- where he basically said that he's frustrated he hasn't won a coveted statuette in his career ... despite having been nominated a whopping ten times already. 
       
           TS says he knows a lot of people in the music biz -- including  Drake ,  The Weeknd  and others -- have  thrown up two middle fingers  at the Recording Academy ... but he isn't there yet. 
       
           Travis notes that a pro in any industry -- especially competitive ones, like sports -- is in it to win it ... and he says he's no different, explaining that being recognized for his work and honored among his peers is important to him. 
       
           He goes on to say that the prestige that Grammys have historically held still carries weight in his mind -- which is why he says it sucks to get strung along for so many years without a prize, especially when you get booked to perform -- like he has many, many times. 
       
           As we reported ... Travis seemed to  throw a fit  at this year's Grammy Awards when he was snubbed once again -- lashing out on stage and breaking a lot of the stage props for his performance. 
       
           He was up for Best Rap Album and lost to  Killer Mike  ... who had  his own trouble at the Grammys . But when it comes to chasing the elusive trophy, Travis says he still wants it.

           Ne-Yo  wants the government to stay out of his love life ... saying he thinks polygamists should be allowed to marry multiple people -- while holding hands with his two partners! 
       
           We caught up with the singer-songwriter at The Grove in Los Angeles Thursday ... and he made his feelings pretty clear ... consenting adults should do whatever the hell they want in their love lives without government interference. 
       
           That said, Ne-Yo says he's not going to Washington, D.C. to fight for a law change ... 'cause it's not currently affecting his personal life, and he's not sure he wants to marry multiple women. 
       
           We also asked Ne-Yo why he doesn't write songs about dating multiple women ... and, he says it's 'cause he draws on his own life experiences, and this is his first relationship with two women. 
       
           And, we even asked Ne-Yo's GFs if they're interested in walking down the aisle together to marry the star ... and, ya gotta see their reactions to the question. 
       
           Ne-Yo enjoying a polygamous relationship ain't new ... remember, we told you Ne-Yo was spotted down in Miami  holding hands with two women  last summer -- after  his divorce  from ex-wife,  Crystal Renay . 
       
           The two split in part because of Ne-Yo's infidelity ... and, it seems a relationship with two women may suit him better than a relationship with just one.

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

Kanye & Bianca Out For An Afternoon Drive ... Battery Report No Big Deal,"
           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

           Drake has been owning up to his ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" track ... using the lyrics to tease both  Metro Boomin  and Kendrick's manager on social media ... but Tour√© feels sneaky tactics pale in comparison to the points K. Dot has already put on the board. 
       
           Remember, Kendrick's feature on  Future  and Metro's  ""Like That"" record  has been No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 3 straight weeks now and Tour√© is daring any DJ to try and drop ""Push Ups"" in the club ... he says the song will bomb!!! 
       
           Tour√© says Kendrick and everyone else is well within their rights to fire back at Drake after years of sneak disses ... and he's strongly against giving Drake a handicap for not showing signs of obliteration. 
       
           It's an interesting viewpoint ... especially since Drake claimed it was Kendrick who gets the benefit of the doubt over him. 
       
           At any rate, Tour√©'s convinced a Kendrick nuke is coming. His backers are speaking similar code.

           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out.

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"
           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in '63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn't going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. 
       
           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"
           Kim Kardashian 's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. 
       
           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyonc√© Fans,"
           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

Jill Scott Blown Up for Chris Brown Defense ... After His Quavo Attack,"
           Jill Scott  isn't going to let  Chris Brown ‚Äôs checkered past block her enjoyment of listening to him lyrically pummel  Quavo , and she's been fending off critics who wished she didn't cape for Chris!!! 
       
           The ripple effect from Chris' brutal ""Weakest Link"" graced Jill's radar over the weekend and she couldn't help, but gush over the embattled singer's MC skills ... ‚Äú@chrisbrown is amazing. How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap‚Ä¶ like THAT?‚Äù wrote Scott on Sunday morning. 
       
           ‚ÄúBeyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional üî•. There‚Äôs nothing to debate.‚Äù 
       
           The praise struck a nerve with fans on X, many felt CB had gone too far on the diss -- especially with his record of domestic violence with  Rihanna . 
       
           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments. 
       
           Despite the backlash, people are enjoying CB's spill --. the song has nearly 2 million plays on his YouTube channel, and would inevitably rack up more if he put the song on streaming.

T-Pain Victim in ATL Hit-and-Run ... Vows REVENGE!!!,"
           So much for Sunday Funday  ...  T-Pain 's weekend came to a crashing end in Atlanta, when a speeding driver severely rear-ended the Auto-Tune Don's vehicle, and fled the scene without a word!!! 
       
           A calm yet irritated T-Pain went live from the scene of the accident and pointed out a very valuable clue for police ... the driver had left their bumper in the street, and it was only a matter of time before they matched the silver Chevy with the missing part. 
       
           Turns out he was right ... T-Pain posted an update, letting fans know the driver had been caught, and gauging by his use of the üòà emoji, he plans on showing the guy no mercy. 
       
           He says the principle of the driver not stopping to check on their well-being is what got him hot, although it appeared his own personal driver was headed to the hospital for medical attention. 
       
           The crash forced T-Pain to alter his packed itinerary but something tells us he'll make up for it in legal justice.

           The Kansas City Chiefs superstar and his longtime partner had a romantic trip in Cabo San Lucas over the past several days ... but on Sunday, it was all about the girls. 
       
           Brittany was spotted on a luxurious yacht with at least four other ladies ... soaking up the sun as they lounged on the back deck. 
       
           Britt rocked a tiny, orange two-piece for the occasion ... which is something she's quite accustomed to lately, as she was named to  SI's newest swimsuit issue  back in February. 
       
           No word on what all the ladies got into ... but chances are they had  Taylor Swift 's new 'Tortured Poets Department' album blaring on the speakers, considering Brittany was  super pumped  for  Travis Kelce 's girlfriend when the project dropped. 
       
           It was quite the eventful trip for the Mahomeses -- as we previously reported, the couple was  heckled by Raiders fans  while out at dinner together last week.

           The singer dropped her in-depth hair-washing routine on IG Sunday ... embracing her naturally thick, glossy tresses as they were washed, conditioned, blow-dried, and styled using products from her own brand, C√©cred. 
       
           While her stylists worked their magic, Beyonc√© narrated, ""Now that C√©cred is known for the quality in what it does for your hair, I think it's about time I show y'all what it does for my hair."" 
       
           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!"" 
       
           Beyonc√©'s dad,  Mathew Knowles , already stepped up to back his daughter ... telling TMZ she definitely knows a thing or 2 about  keeping hair happy and healthy , considering he and   Tina Knowles  ran a successful salon in Houston for nearly 2 decades. 
       
           And, judging by Bey's hair care routine, looks like her products are totally making waves. Now, will that be enough to silence the hate? Of course not.

           Celine Dion  says she's doing all she can to prove nothing can hold her back, even as she copes with Stiff-Person Syndrome ... 2 years on from when she was first diagnosed. 
       
           The icon admits she's upset she hasn't conquered the disease yet -- but, as she provided a rare update about her health to  Vogue France , she insisted she was doing everything in her power to push forward in hopes science will eventually find a cure. 
       
           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery. 
       
           The legend's taking things one day at a time, but she's got her sights set on some big goals ... such as seeing the Eiffel Tower again and hitting the road for another tour. 
       
           Celine empoweringly added, ""There's one thing that will never stop, and that's the will. It's the passion. It's the dream. It's the determination.""

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend. 
       
           As they say, out with the old, in with the new -- even for an Ellwood classic.

           The pioneering hip hop duo was on the ballot for this year's induction, but came up short in the final vote. Instead,  Mary J. Blige ,  Cher , Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner,  Peter Frampton , Kool & The Gang,  Ozzy Osbourne  and A Tribe Called Quest will be entering the Hall. 
       
           However, the two legends want it to be clear there are no hard feelings on their part, as they're happily congratulating their peers who will be inducted. 
       
           Eric B & Rakim tell TMZ Hip Hop ... ""Congratulations to the diverse group of artists inducted into the Rock Hall this year. Seeing Tribe and Mary on the list besides Cher, Ozzy, Kool and the Gang and all of the other icons shows how inclusive the institution has become."" 
       
           Though, Eric B. and Rakim are still eyeing the honor for themselves at some point. They add ... ""Keep voting ... we'll join you soon!"" 
       
           Eric B. & Rakim rose to fame during rap's golden age in the '80s and '90s, releasing 4 successful albums -- ""Paid in Full,"" ""Follow the Leader,"" ""Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em,"" and ""Don't Sweat the Technique."" 
       
           The duo was named on the nominations list alongside a diverse group of performers, and as far as the acts that didn't get in this year, they're in excellent company --  Mariah Carey , Jane‚Äôs Addiction,  Sade ,  Sinead O‚ÄôConnor , Oasis and  Lenny Kravitz  will all have to wait for another chance to join the Hall of Fame party. 
       
           Eric B. & Rakim were previously nominated for the Hall of Fame in 2012. So, it's entirely likely they'll score another nomination in the future.

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women.

           TMZ Hip Hop caught up with the ""Right Thurr"" rapper ahead of the debut of his ""Unsung"" episode on TV One. He's on his ""Nu Beginnings"" wave courtesy of his brand-new single released today, but still has a sour taste in his mouth over the  Sidney Starr  situation  he says  killed his career climb. 
       
           Chingy recalls being blackballed when Sidney, a transgender model, lied about sleeping with him back in the day, and tells us her eventual apology barely did any real damage control. 
       
           The St. Louis rapper came out the gate with a multi-platinum debut in 2003, and put many bullets on the Billboard charts. 
       
           However, he says he saw, firsthand, how easily fans can forget about you when the mainstream machine isn't pumping your product. 
       
           Speaking of the mainstream, Chingy also fears  Drake  and  Kendrick Lamar 's  current clash  is getting way too intense ... and the back-and-forth stingers could escalate to violence if they're not careful. 
       
           Rap hasn't been keeping the peace as of late, but Chingy feels it can be done.

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"
           9:45 AM PT  --  Kid Cudi  just posted a video update detailing what happened during his jump offstage, ""This is what happens when a 40-year-old man tries to prance around off stage like he's 26."" 
       
           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

"Kanye West Jumping Into Rap Beef ... Drops Drake, J. Cole Diss","
           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Jake Plummer Down For Pat Tillman HOF Honor ... But I Know His Legacy Will Go On Regardless,"
           If  Pat Tillman  ever gets honored at the Pro Football Hall of Fame,  Jake Plummer  will be the first one there for the ceremony ... although he tells  TMZ Sports  if it doesn't happen, he knows the hero's legacy will go on regardless. 
       
           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too. 
       
           ""I think about him a lot,"" Jake said, ""and I know he's inspiring a lot of people to be better."" 
       
           We discussed Pat's legacy on a previous episode of  Last Days , available on all podcast platforms.

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

David Beckham Sues Mark Wahlberg's Co. ... You're Unfit to Make Fitness Deals!!!,"
           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

Nicki Minaj Almost Nailed by Object ... Hurls it Back Into Crowd!!!,"
           Nicki Minaj  will not stand for objects being thrown at her -- giving one concertgoer a taste of their own medicine. 
       
           Check it out .. during a performance of her hit song ""Starships,"" the rapper swats away an item as it flies toward her face. Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. 
       
           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. 
       
           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows. 
       
           We're not sure why this trend is growing ... but celebs are def over it!!!

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

           Adrien Broner   says  Devin Haney   needs him now more than ever -- after suffering the first loss of his career on Saturday -- with AB challenging the 31-1 boxer to a fight! 
       
           34-year-old Broner, 35-4, made a video addressing 25-year-old Haney after Saturday's fight at Barclays in Brooklyn ... one of the most shocking upsets of the year. 
       
           ""I know everybody waiting on my reaction, but I'mma just tell the truth,"" Broner said in an Instagram video. 
       
           ""Ay Devin! You gotta fight me now n****! S***, right now, you need me n****!"" 
       
           The fight offer was followed by some trolling ... AB took a shot at Haney's father,  Bill , who he's had beef with for some time. 
       
           ""Hold on, anybody seen Bill? Where the f*** is Bill at?!"" Broner said. ""Nah, we know where Devin at. Devin probably trying to get his thoughts together and s***. He'll be alright."" 
       
           ""Where the f*** Bill at?! Bill?!"" 
       
           Broner wasn't the only boxer throwing shade at the Haneys ...  Gervonta 'Tank' Davis , the only fighter to beat  Ryan Garcia ,   also trolled Devin and his crew. 
       
           ""Forget Devin.. WHERE BILL AT WHERE DIRT AT!!!!!!!!!"" Davis said on X. ""And what about you d**k riding ass people.""

           ""SORRY I BET ON BASEBALL"" and ""OHTANI IS SORRY ALSO"" are two of the phrases the hit king signed at the Fiterman Sports Group signing in St. Paul, Minnesota ... attended by a large group of collectors. 
       
           83-year-old Rose also signed ... ""I WISH I HAD AN INTERPRETER"" 
       
           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it. 
       
           Major League Baseball has pressed pause on their investigation, opting to wait until Mizuhara's criminal case is closed, to determine if they'll investigate Ohtani, or anyone else involved, any further.

           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury. 
       
           As Sly put it to us ... pushing through the pain is just what driven folks like Arnold and himself did to make it to the top.

Comedian Elayne Boosler I Was Arrested At Dodger Game ... All 'Cause Of My Bag?!?,"
           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries.

           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain't all that. 
       
           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man's new title ... and it's safe to say she's pissed, 'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. 
       
           ""My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met,"" Bonilla said. ""He hasn't stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career."" 
       
           ""It's hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense,"" she added. ""I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind."" 
       
           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run.

           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a ""blessing"" to start a family.

           ""I truly believe that football life is not simple about what you do but rather who you do it with and I was a better player because of the people I was surrounded by,"" Ryan added.

Dwyane Wade 'High Dining' For Best Buds ... Gabrielle Makes Magic!!!,"
           Dwyane Wade 's annual ""High Dining"" dinner, in honor of 420, went down with several of the NBA great's famous pals rolling up to join the festivities -- including a few surprises. 
       
           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities. 
       
           His wife  Gabrielle Union  stood in as magician  Kevin Li 's assistant -- thankfully everyone kept their hands to themselves, and no one was sliced and diced on the table. üëÄ 
       
           The event also debuted Jeeter and the  Bob Marley  estate's master collaboration -- a 4.2-gram pre-roll packaged in a guitar case ... in other words, a Jah-endorsed rollout! 
       
           Bob's grandson, Grammy-nominated singer  Skip Marley  also performed ""Jamming"" and ""One Love"" -- and the significance of having the latest generation of Marley hitmakers present needed no explanation.

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"
           4:37 PM PT --  Bam Margera  just posted video to Instagram showing a portion of the attempts he says he made to call 911 for police assistance last week ... recorded before he ended up taking matters into his own hands, fighting off a threatening stranger. 
       
           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. 
       
           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden . 
       
           It's hard not to remember the break-in at  Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco home back in 2022 ... when her husband  Paul Pelosi  was  bludgeoned with a hammer  by  David DePape . 
       
           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect."" 
       
           We're told LAPD's elite Robbery and Homicide division is investigating the case.

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc√©, and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience.""

           When Tina asked how much time she needed to get ready, Ashanti coyly replied ""9 months"" ... and also captioned the post ""Baby, baby, baby, baby"" and clearly wasn't referencing her 2002 hit!!! 
       
           It was Nelly who first tipped off fans -- way  back in December  -- when he gleefully kept rubbing on Ashanti's belly. It wasn't hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they've made it official.

           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me.""

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"
           10:16 PM PT  -- A rep for  Kanye West  tells TMZ ... ""'Grabbed' is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted."" 
       
           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

"Kodak Black I'm Off the Hook!!! Drug, Tampering Charges Dismissed","
           Kodak Black  can now place his recent drug possession case in his rearview mirror ... the last significant charge in the case was tossed out this week!!! 
       
           Court docs obtained by TMZ Hip Hop show a judge just dismissed the remaining tampering charge against the Florida rapper -- this after previously tossing the drug possession charges, back in February, after Kodak showed he had a prescription for the drugs. 
       
           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them. 
       
           His new single, ""Stressed Out,"" is probably a fitting description of his mood prior to getting the good news.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

Drake Trollin' Kendrick's Manager ... Where Is This Supposed Smoke?!?,"
           Drake  has turned his scope away from  Metro Boomin  and  Rick Ross , and returned it to the main event ...  Kendrick Lamar !!! 
       
           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily. 
       
           Nonetheless ... Kendrick's West Coast peeps are confident he'll prevail in the end. üëÄ

"Travis Scott I'll Be Honest, Grammys Matter ... And I Wanna Win One!!!","
           Travis Scott  says while many of his contemporaries have turned their back on the Grammys -- he's still holding out hope he can snag one ... 'cause he still finds they hold value. 
       
           The rapper got brutally honest on a new episode of  LeBron James ' show 'The Shop' -- where he basically said that he's frustrated he hasn't won a coveted statuette in his career ... despite having been nominated a whopping ten times already. 
       
           TS says he knows a lot of people in the music biz -- including  Drake ,  The Weeknd  and others -- have  thrown up two middle fingers  at the Recording Academy ... but he isn't there yet. 
       
           Travis notes that a pro in any industry -- especially competitive ones, like sports -- is in it to win it ... and he says he's no different, explaining that being recognized for his work and honored among his peers is important to him. 
       
           He goes on to say that the prestige that Grammys have historically held still carries weight in his mind -- which is why he says it sucks to get strung along for so many years without a prize, especially when you get booked to perform -- like he has many, many times. 
       
           As we reported ... Travis seemed to  throw a fit  at this year's Grammy Awards when he was snubbed once again -- lashing out on stage and breaking a lot of the stage props for his performance. 
       
           He was up for Best Rap Album and lost to  Killer Mike  ... who had  his own trouble at the Grammys . But when it comes to chasing the elusive trophy, Travis says he still wants it.

           Drake  will be licking his wounds and bowing to King  Kendrick Lamar  ... a shameful sight  Tour√©  says will become Drake's reality after their rap battle is all said and done. 
       
           The tenured music and cultural critic hopped on ""TMZ Live"" on Thursday and pinpointed what he feels are dings in Drake's armor ... mainly his comeback response, which Tour√© isn't all that impressed with. 
       
           Drake has been owning up to his ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" track ... using the lyrics to tease both  Metro Boomin  and Kendrick's manager on social media ... but Tour√© feels sneaky tactics pale in comparison to the points K. Dot has already put on the board. 
       
           Remember, Kendrick's feature on  Future  and Metro's  ""Like That"" record  has been No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 3 straight weeks now and Tour√© is daring any DJ to try and drop ""Push Ups"" in the club ... he says the song will bomb!!! 
       
           Tour√© says Kendrick and everyone else is well within their rights to fire back at Drake after years of sneak disses ... and he's strongly against giving Drake a handicap for not showing signs of obliteration. 
       
           It's an interesting viewpoint ... especially since Drake claimed it was Kendrick who gets the benefit of the doubt over him. 
       
           At any rate, Tour√©'s convinced a Kendrick nuke is coming. His backers are speaking similar code.

Damian Lillard Estranged Wife Clowns GloRilla ... After DUI Arrest,"
           Damian Lillard 's estranged wife was apparently not a fan of  GloRilla  recently shooting her shot at the NBA superstar ... the hooper's ex clowned the Memphis rapper shortly after she was arrested for DUI. 
       
           GloRilla  was arrested  in Georgia on Tuesday for suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container, as well as another traffic charge. 
       
           Kay'La  -- who was married to Dame from September 2021 until he  filed for divorce  in October 2023 -- saw the legal trouble as an opportunity to roast the rapper ... this after she said she wanted to be with the Milwaukee Bucks guard. 
       
           ""Free GloLillard,"" Kay'La wrote on a photo of Glo's mugshot on Instagram, adding the hashtag, ""#sisterwifeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"" 
       
           Fans instantly caught on to the shade ... and had plenty to say about the cryptic message. 
       
           ""She mad, hurt, and taking it out on the wrong person,"" a follower commented. 
       
           Others believe Kay'La -- who has three kids with Lillard -- was joking ... with most people feeling she missed the mark. 
       
           Another wrote ... ""Didn‚Äôt he file for a divorce üò©üò© this is cringey af."" 
       
           Glo, nor Dame, has responded ... not surprising given the hooper has an NBA playoff series coming up.

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           We also asked Ne-Yo why he doesn't write songs about dating multiple women ... and, he says it's 'cause he draws on his own life experiences, and this is his first relationship with two women. 
       
           And, we even asked Ne-Yo's GFs if they're interested in walking down the aisle together to marry the star ... and, ya gotta see their reactions to the question.

           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight.""

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

O.J. SIMPSON BANK OF AMERICA CREDIT CARD Up for AUCTION,"
           O.J. Simpson 's Bank of America credit card has hit the auction block ... and let's just say the seller is banking on it raking in some serious cash. 
       
           Jonathan Lepore  is selling the business account card over at  Goldin Auctions  ... telling TMZ he snagged the piece of plastic, which expired in 2023, on eBay last summer for a steal at $70, adding it to his trove of sports memorabilia. 
       
           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

Kanye & Bianca Out For An Afternoon Drive ... Battery Report No Big Deal,"
           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

Taylor Swift Smooches Travis Kelce In 'Fortnight' Vid,"
           Taylor Swift  can't hide she's totally smitten with BF  Travis Kelce  in her new YouTube promotional clip for her first music video, ""Fortnight,"" off her recently released 11th album. 
       
           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment. 
       
           But Taylor's not giving any love to her ex  Joe Alwyn  on her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" which was officially released Friday. 
       
           In one song, ""So Long London,"" Taylor  rips into Alwyn  for his alleged depression, which she seemingly attributes to their break-up. 
       
           Taylor also took a major shot at  Kim Kardashian  in another tune, 'thanK you aIMee,""  comparing the reality star to a schoolyard bully  and reigniting their feud from years ago.

           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad. 
       
           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry. 
       
           ""I would love to go ahead and make my own impact,"" he said. 
       
           As for off the field, Brenden doesn't mind being like pops there ... because he just teamed up with Breathe Right to recreate the famous ""Air Jerry"" ad that the elder Rice was a part of in his heyday. 
       
           Brenden took pics with the nasal strip to emulate his pops for the company -- and he told us he was stoked to get to wear the product while on the gridiron ... just like Jerry. 
       
           As for where Brenden will be seen next in the strips ... he said he's been hearing a lot from the Chargers, Cardinals, Buccaneers, Eagles, and Jets.

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers. 
       
           In 2016, Jenkins tried to latch on with the Cardinals, but he got injured in the preseason ... and never played another down in the NFL again.

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"

           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows.

           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"

           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. 
       
           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam.

David Beckham Sues Mark Wahlberg's Co. ... You're Unfit to Make Fitness Deals!!!,"
           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury. 
       
           As Sly put it to us ... pushing through the pain is just what driven folks like Arnold and himself did to make it to the top.

NASCAR Massive Crash At Talladega ... Tyler Reddick Ends Up Winning,"
           A brutal crash went down in the closing moments of NASCAR's Geico 500 at Talladega on Sunday ... taking out several cars in the final lap and paving the way for  Tyler Reddick  to come away with the win. 
       
           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega. 
       
           Michael Jordan  was proud of his driver's crazy win ... and celebrated with his family, including Reddick's son. 
       
           This is Reddick's sixth Cup Series win of his career ... and given how he earned it, it may be one of the most memorable.

Jake Plummer Down For Pat Tillman HOF Honor ... But I Know His Legacy Will Go On Regardless,"
           If  Pat Tillman  ever gets honored at the Pro Football Hall of Fame,  Jake Plummer  will be the first one there for the ceremony ... although he tells  TMZ Sports  if it doesn't happen, he knows the hero's legacy will go on regardless. 
       
           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too. 
       
           ""I think about him a lot,"" Jake said, ""and I know he's inspiring a lot of people to be better."" 
       
           We discussed Pat's legacy on a previous episode of  Last Days , available on all podcast platforms.

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

Comedian Elayne Boosler I Was Arrested At Dodger Game ... All 'Cause Of My Bag?!?,"
           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

Pete Rose Roasts Ohtani Over Betting Scandal ... At Autoraph Signing,"
           Pete Rose  trolled  Shohei Ohtani  over the weekend, poking fun at the Dodgers superstar at an autograph signing ... all over the  Ippei Mizhuara  betting scandal. 
       
           ""SORRY I BET ON BASEBALL"" and ""OHTANI IS SORRY ALSO"" are two of the phrases the hit king signed at the Fiterman Sports Group signing in St. Paul, Minnesota ... attended by a large group of collectors. 
       
           83-year-old Rose also signed ... ""I WISH I HAD AN INTERPRETER"" 
       
           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it. 
       
           Major League Baseball has pressed pause on their investigation, opting to wait until Mizuhara's criminal case is closed, to determine if they'll investigate Ohtani, or anyone else involved, any further. 
       
           But, you know where Pete stands.

           The Atlanta Falcons great -- who played all but one season with the organization -- released a heartfelt goodbye to the game on Monday ... saying it was time to hang up the helmet. 
       
           ""Today, 16 years after being drafted, my childhood dream has officially come to an end,"" Ryan said. 
       
           ""I'm honored to retire as a Falcon."" 
       
           Ryan -- the third overall pick in 2008 -- played his best season in 2016 ... leading the league in passer rating and being named first-team All-Pro. 
       
           He threw for nearly 63,000 yards during his time under center ... and had 381 touchdowns and just 183 interceptions. 
       
           Ryan -- the franchise's all-time wins leader for a quarterback -- led the Falcons to a NFC Championship in 2017. 
       
           Ryan shouted out several members of the Falcons organization ... including owner  Arthur Blank  and teammates like  Tony Gonzalez ,  Michael Turner ,  Roddy White  and, of course,  Julio Jones . 
       
           ""I truly believe that football life is not simple about what you do but rather who you do it with and I was a better player because of the people I was surrounded by,"" Ryan added. 
       
           The four-time Pro Bowler played his final season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2022 ... going 4-7-1 in 12 games. 
       
           He spent the 2023 campaign working for CBS on NFL Sundays.

           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities.

           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain't all that. 
       
           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man's new title ... and it's safe to say she's pissed, 'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. 
       
           ""My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met,"" Bonilla said. ""He hasn't stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career."" 
       
           ""It's hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense,"" she added. ""I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind."" 
       
           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run. 
       
           ""I am proud of you, and our son is proud of you."" 
       
           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a ""blessing"" to start a family.

           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it.

           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry.

           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

T-Pain Victim in ATL Hit-and-Run ... Vows REVENGE!!!,"
           So much for Sunday Funday  ...  T-Pain 's weekend came to a crashing end in Atlanta, when a speeding driver severely rear-ended the Auto-Tune Don's vehicle, and fled the scene without a word!!! 
       
           A calm yet irritated T-Pain went live from the scene of the accident and pointed out a very valuable clue for police ... the driver had left their bumper in the street, and it was only a matter of time before they matched the silver Chevy with the missing part. 
       
           Turns out he was right ... T-Pain posted an update, letting fans know the driver had been caught, and gauging by his use of the üòà emoji, he plans on showing the guy no mercy. 
       
           He says the principle of the driver not stopping to check on their well-being is what got him hot, although it appeared his own personal driver was headed to the hospital for medical attention. 
       
           The crash forced T-Pain to alter his packed itinerary but something tells us he'll make up for it in legal justice.

Delta Burke I Tried Crystal Meth to Lose Lbs. ... Didn't Eat for 5 Days!!!,"
           Delta Burke  is revealing the shocking lengths to which she went just to drop a few pounds in her heyday -- using crystal meth as an appetite suppressant! 
       
           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days."" 
       
           Despite her attempts to lose weight, Delta recalled still being criticized for her body, which greatly impacted her mental health ... and even led to her early exit from 'DW.' 
       
           While Delta's admission might seem shocking, she isn't the first celeb to seek drug assistance in order to achieve a body transformation. 
       
           The difference is ... now A-listers get those drugs prescribed, as more and more openly turn to weight-loss meds like Wegovy and Ozempic. 
       
           Oprah ,  Amy Schumer ,  Tracy Morgan ,  Sharon Osbourne  and  Chelsea Handler  have all admitted to  using weight-loss drugs . 
       
           Hey, beats the hell outta meth!

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"
           Kim Kardashian 's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. 
       
           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

CELINE DION GIVES RARE INSIGHT INTO LIFE WITH STIFF-PERSON SYNDROME,"
           Celine Dion  says she's doing all she can to prove nothing can hold her back, even as she copes with Stiff-Person Syndrome ... 2 years on from when she was first diagnosed. 
       
           The icon admits she's upset she hasn't conquered the disease yet -- but, as she provided a rare update about her health to  Vogue France , she insisted she was doing everything in her power to push forward in hopes science will eventually find a cure. 
       
           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery. 
       
           The legend's taking things one day at a time, but she's got her sights set on some big goals ... such as seeing the Eiffel Tower again and hitting the road for another tour. 
       
           Celine empoweringly added, ""There's one thing that will never stop, and that's the will. It's the passion. It's the dream. It's the determination."" 
       
           The ""My Heart Will Go On"" singer was  diagnosed with SPS  in 2022, and her sister previously revealed the autoimmune disorder, at times,  leaves Celine completely immobilized . 
       
           But Celine's managed to power through, making some appearances at  NHL games  and also  the Grammys , where she presented  Taylor Swift  with her  Album of the Year award .

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend. 
       
           As they say, out with the old, in with the new -- even for an Ellwood classic.

BEYONC√â THESE LUSCIOUS LOCkS?! ALL MY OWN! Slams Haters in Tutorial,"
           Beyonc√© 's shutting down the haters and showing she's more than just wigs and extensions ... by embracing her luscious, natural locks while promoting her new natural hair care line. 
       
           The singer dropped her in-depth hair-washing routine on IG Sunday ... embracing her naturally thick, glossy tresses as they were washed, conditioned, blow-dried, and styled using products from her own brand, C√©cred. 
       
           While her stylists worked their magic, Beyonc√© narrated, ""Now that C√©cred is known for the quality in what it does for your hair, I think it's about time I show y'all what it does for my hair."" 
       
           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!"" 
       
           Beyonc√©'s dad,  Mathew Knowles , already stepped up to back his daughter ... telling TMZ she definitely knows a thing or 2 about  keeping hair happy and healthy , considering he and   Tina Knowles  ran a successful salon in Houston for nearly 2 decades. 
       
           And, judging by Bey's hair care routine, looks like her products are totally making waves. Now, will that be enough to silence the hate? Of course not.

Eric B. & Rakim Not Bummed About Rock Hall Snub ... Applaud Inclusivity,"
           Eric B.  &  Rakim  are very happy with the 2024 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees ... despite the fact they didn't personally make the cut. 
       
           The pioneering hip hop duo was on the ballot for this year's induction, but came up short in the final vote. Instead,  Mary J. Blige ,  Cher , Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner,  Peter Frampton , Kool & The Gang,  Ozzy Osbourne  and A Tribe Called Quest will be entering the Hall. 
       
           However, the two legends want it to be clear there are no hard feelings on their part, as they're happily congratulating their peers who will be inducted. 
       
           Eric B & Rakim tell TMZ Hip Hop ... ""Congratulations to the diverse group of artists inducted into the Rock Hall this year. Seeing Tribe and Mary on the list besides Cher, Ozzy, Kool and the Gang and all of the other icons shows how inclusive the institution has become."" 
       
           Though, Eric B. and Rakim are still eyeing the honor for themselves at some point. They add ... ""Keep voting ... we'll join you soon!"" 
       
           Eric B. & Rakim rose to fame during rap's golden age in the '80s and '90s, releasing 4 successful albums -- ""Paid in Full,"" ""Follow the Leader,"" ""Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em,"" and ""Don't Sweat the Technique."" 
       
           The duo was named on the nominations list alongside a diverse group of performers, and as far as the acts that didn't get in this year, they're in excellent company --  Mariah Carey , Jane‚Äôs Addiction,  Sade ,  Sinead O‚ÄôConnor , Oasis and  Lenny Kravitz  will all have to wait for another chance to join the Hall of Fame party. 
       
           Eric B. & Rakim were previously nominated for the Hall of Fame in 2012. So, it's entirely likely they'll score another nomination in the future.

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"
           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in '63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn't going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. 
       
           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"
           9:45 AM PT  --  Kid Cudi  just posted a video update detailing what happened during his jump offstage, ""This is what happens when a 40-year-old man tries to prance around off stage like he's 26."" 
       
           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

Nicki Minaj Almost Nailed by Object ... Hurls it Back Into Crowd!!!,"
           Nicki Minaj  will not stand for objects being thrown at her -- giving one concertgoer a taste of their own medicine. 
       
           Check it out .. during a performance of her hit song ""Starships,"" the rapper swats away an item as it flies toward her face. Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. 
       
           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. 
       
           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows. 
       
           We're not sure why this trend is growing ... but celebs are def over it!!!

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight."" 
       
           It'd be massive ... but first, Saturday night's super fight! üëä

Al Harrington My 4/20 Advice ... 'Get High As F***!!!',"
           Ex-NBA hooper and current weed entrepreneur  Al Harrington  has some solid advice for any newbies looking to celebrate the 4/20 holiday this year ... telling  TMZ Sports  it's pretty simple -- ""get high as f***!!!"" 
       
           Harrington knows his stuff -- the guy built an entire company around his love for Mary Jane ... serving as the CEO of the Viola brand. 
       
           He's doing pretty well for himself, too ... with the company valued at over $100 million. 
       
           Harrington -- who played 16 seasons in the league for a number of teams -- told us he'll be in NYC for a three-day ""4/20 Tour"" this weekend ... 'cause apparently, the dude needs way more than 24 hours to show his love for cannabis. 
       
           Harrington has been a huge advocate for the benefits of marijuana -- in 2017, he sat down with former NBA commish  David Stern  ... and the conversation helped the league eventually take weed off the banned substances list. 
       
           As for folks looking to dabble with some doobies, Harrington says there's no need to complicate it ... just puff, puff, pass and enjoy yourself.

Dutch Soccer Final Fire Breaks Out Behind Goal ... Game Delayed 30 Minutes,"
           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo.

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers. 
       
           In 2016, Jenkins tried to latch on with the Cardinals, but he got injured in the preseason ... and never played another down in the NFL again.

Brenden Rice Jerry's Son Won't Wear No. 80 In NFL ... Determined To Create Own Legacy,"
           Another Rice is making his way to the NFL this season ... but don't expect him to look anything like  Jerry  on gamedays -- no,  Brenden Rice  tells  TMZ Sports  he's gunning to be his own man when it comes time to perform on Sundays. 
       
           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad. 
       
           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry. 
       
           ""I would love to go ahead and make my own impact,"" he said. 
       
           As for off the field, Brenden doesn't mind being like pops there ... because he just teamed up with Breathe Right to recreate the famous ""Air Jerry"" ad that the elder Rice was a part of in his heyday. 
       
           Brenden took pics with the nasal strip to emulate his pops for the company -- and he told us he was stoked to get to wear the product while on the gridiron ... just like Jerry. 
       
           As for where Brenden will be seen next in the strips ... he said he's been hearing a lot from the Chargers, Cardinals, Buccaneers, Eagles, and Jets. 
       
           But, he said he's down to play anywhere ... just as long as they give him a shot to ""create my own legacy and my own name.""

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden . 
       
           It's hard not to remember the break-in at  Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco home back in 2022 ... when her husband  Paul Pelosi  was  bludgeoned with a hammer  by  David DePape . 
       
           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect."" 
       
           We're told LAPD's elite Robbery and Homicide division is investigating the case.

Arnold Schwarzenegger Here's How I Punked Sly Into Starring in Movie Flop!!!,"
           Arnold Schwarzenegger  epically punked  Sylvester Stallone  into signing on for the most disastrous film of Sly's career, and that's exactly what Arnold wanted to happen! 
       
           Arnold and Sly sat down with  Harvey  for a candid, sometimes stunning convo about the intense rivalry between the 2 mega-action stars. 
       
           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

"Spring Breakers Can't Stop Brawlin', Trash the Ocean","

           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well.""

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

'90 Day Fianc√©' Liz Slams 'Weakling' Big Ed For Calling Off Wedding!!!,"

           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months.

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

Damian Lillard Estranged Wife Clowns GloRilla ... After DUI Arrest,"
           Damian Lillard 's estranged wife was apparently not a fan of  GloRilla  recently shooting her shot at the NBA superstar ... the hooper's ex clowned the Memphis rapper shortly after she was arrested for DUI. 
       
           GloRilla  was arrested  in Georgia on Tuesday for suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container, as well as another traffic charge. 
       
           Kay'La  -- who was married to Dame from September 2021 until he  filed for divorce  in October 2023 -- saw the legal trouble as an opportunity to roast the rapper ... this after she said she wanted to be with the Milwaukee Bucks guard. 
       
           ""Free GloLillard,"" Kay'La wrote on a photo of Glo's mugshot on Instagram, adding the hashtag, ""#sisterwifeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"" 
       
           Fans instantly caught on to the shade ... and had plenty to say about the cryptic message. 
       
           ""She mad, hurt, and taking it out on the wrong person,"" a follower commented. 
       
           Others believe Kay'La -- who has three kids with Lillard -- was joking ... with most people feeling she missed the mark. 
       
           Another wrote ... ""Didn‚Äôt he file for a divorce üò©üò© this is cringey af."" 
       
           Glo, nor Dame, has responded ... not surprising given the hooper has an NBA playoff series coming up. 
       
           Game 1 of the Bucks vs. Pacers series starts Sunday.

"Kodak Black I'm Off the Hook!!! Drug, Tampering Charges Dismissed","
           Kodak Black  can now place his recent drug possession case in his rearview mirror ... the last significant charge in the case was tossed out this week!!! 
       
           Court docs obtained by TMZ Hip Hop show a judge just dismissed the remaining tampering charge against the Florida rapper -- this after previously tossing the drug possession charges, back in February, after Kodak showed he had a prescription for the drugs. 
       
           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them. 
       
           His new single, ""Stressed Out,"" is probably a fitting description of his mood prior to getting the good news.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

Drake Trollin' Kendrick's Manager ... Where Is This Supposed Smoke?!?,"
           Drake  has turned his scope away from  Metro Boomin  and  Rick Ross , and returned it to the main event ...  Kendrick Lamar !!! 
       
           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

           TS says he knows a lot of people in the music biz -- including  Drake ,  The Weeknd  and others -- have  thrown up two middle fingers  at the Recording Academy ... but he isn't there yet. 
       
           Travis notes that a pro in any industry -- especially competitive ones, like sports -- is in it to win it ... and he says he's no different, explaining that being recognized for his work and honored among his peers is important to him. 
       
           He goes on to say that the prestige that Grammys have historically held still carries weight in his mind -- which is why he says it sucks to get strung along for so many years without a prize, especially when you get booked to perform -- like he has many, many times. 
       
           As we reported ... Travis seemed to  throw a fit  at this year's Grammy Awards when he was snubbed once again -- lashing out on stage and breaking a lot of the stage props for his performance.

           Drake has been owning up to his ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" track ... using the lyrics to tease both  Metro Boomin  and Kendrick's manager on social media ... but Tour√© feels sneaky tactics pale in comparison to the points K. Dot has already put on the board. 
       
           Remember, Kendrick's feature on  Future  and Metro's  ""Like That"" record  has been No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 3 straight weeks now and Tour√© is daring any DJ to try and drop ""Push Ups"" in the club ... he says the song will bomb!!! 
       
           Tour√© says Kendrick and everyone else is well within their rights to fire back at Drake after years of sneak disses ... and he's strongly against giving Drake a handicap for not showing signs of obliteration. 
       
           It's an interesting viewpoint ... especially since Drake claimed it was Kendrick who gets the benefit of the doubt over him.

Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes.

           Eric B.  &  Rakim  are very happy with the 2024 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees ... despite the fact they didn't personally make the cut. 
       
           The pioneering hip hop duo was on the ballot for this year's induction, but came up short in the final vote. Instead,  Mary J. Blige ,  Cher , Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner,  Peter Frampton , Kool & The Gang,  Ozzy Osbourne  and A Tribe Called Quest will be entering the Hall. 
       
           However, the two legends want it to be clear there are no hard feelings on their part, as they're happily congratulating their peers who will be inducted. 
       
           Eric B & Rakim tell TMZ Hip Hop ... ""Congratulations to the diverse group of artists inducted into the Rock Hall this year. Seeing Tribe and Mary on the list besides Cher, Ozzy, Kool and the Gang and all of the other icons shows how inclusive the institution has become."" 
       
           Though, Eric B. and Rakim are still eyeing the honor for themselves at some point. They add ... ""Keep voting ... we'll join you soon!"" 
       
           Eric B. & Rakim rose to fame during rap's golden age in the '80s and '90s, releasing 4 successful albums -- ""Paid in Full,"" ""Follow the Leader,"" ""Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em,"" and ""Don't Sweat the Technique."" 
       
           The duo was named on the nominations list alongside a diverse group of performers, and as far as the acts that didn't get in this year, they're in excellent company --  Mariah Carey , Jane‚Äôs Addiction,  Sade ,  Sinead O‚ÄôConnor , Oasis and  Lenny Kravitz  will all have to wait for another chance to join the Hall of Fame party. 
       
           Eric B. & Rakim were previously nominated for the Hall of Fame in 2012. So, it's entirely likely they'll score another nomination in the future.

           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss.

           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"
           4:37 PM PT --  Bam Margera  just posted video to Instagram showing a portion of the attempts he says he made to call 911 for police assistance last week ... recorded before he ended up taking matters into his own hands, fighting off a threatening stranger. 
       
           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. 
       
           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam.

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"
           9:45 AM PT  --  Kid Cudi  just posted a video update detailing what happened during his jump offstage, ""This is what happens when a 40-year-old man tries to prance around off stage like he's 26."" 
       
           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

Nicki Minaj Almost Nailed by Object ... Hurls it Back Into Crowd!!!,"
           Nicki Minaj  will not stand for objects being thrown at her -- giving one concertgoer a taste of their own medicine. 
       
           Check it out .. during a performance of her hit song ""Starships,"" the rapper swats away an item as it flies toward her face. Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. 
       
           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. 
       
           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows. 
       
           We're not sure why this trend is growing ... but celebs are def over it!!!

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

"Chingy Music Industry Full of BS ... Don't Take The Bait, Drake & Kendrick!!!","
           Chingy  is ready for his second wind of music success, but he's wary of the industry -- telling us he's been burned by bad rumors and beef, and doesn't want to see future artists suffer the same fate!!! 
       
           TMZ Hip Hop caught up with the ""Right Thurr"" rapper ahead of the debut of his ""Unsung"" episode on TV One. He's on his ""Nu Beginnings"" wave courtesy of his brand-new single released today, but still has a sour taste in his mouth over the  Sidney Starr  situation  he says  killed his career climb. 
       
           Chingy recalls being blackballed when Sidney, a transgender model, lied about sleeping with him back in the day, and tells us her eventual apology barely did any real damage control. 
       
           The St. Louis rapper came out the gate with a multi-platinum debut in 2003, and put many bullets on the Billboard charts. 
       
           However, he says he saw, firsthand, how easily fans can forget about you when the mainstream machine isn't pumping your product. 
       
           Speaking of the mainstream, Chingy also fears  Drake  and  Kendrick Lamar 's  current clash  is getting way too intense ... and the back-and-forth stingers could escalate to violence if they're not careful. 
       
           Rap hasn't been keeping the peace as of late, but Chingy feels it can be done.

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities.

           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

Delta Burke I Tried Crystal Meth to Lose Lbs. ... Didn't Eat for 5 Days!!!,"
           Delta Burke  is revealing the shocking lengths to which she went just to drop a few pounds in her heyday -- using crystal meth as an appetite suppressant! 
       
           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days.""

MINNESOTA CAR CRASH Up in Flames ... Driver Saved by Brave Passersby!!!,"
           A bunch of good Samaritans banded together to save a driver from a burning car at the very last second ... and the harrowing rescue is all on video. 
       
           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. 
       
           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. 
       
           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. 
       
           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. 
       
           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries.

LUKE BRYAN MEATy Backside Broke My Fall üçëüôèüèΩ,"
           Luke Bryan 's counting his blessings for the extra padding that saved him when he took a nasty tumble onstage during his latest concert stop. 
       
           We caught up with the country star at Cecconi's Monday in L.A. ... and he joked his weekend slip-and-fall wasn't as painful as it looked 'cause he's got ""a whole lot of meat back there"" -- referring to his butt, of course -- which softened the landing. 
       
           ICYMI, the initial buzz was Luke  went horizontal  Saturday -- during his performance at the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver -- due to a fan's phone that was left on the stage. 
       
           But, a later video angle showed he simply slipped on the floor ... perhaps on some moisture or liquid. Either way, Luke's told us he's still scratching his head over what exactly sent him plummeting. 
       
           He clearly didn't mind being the butt of the joke, though, as he spoke to us -- and also by the way he reacted with good humor seconds after going down. 
       
           In the viral clip of his fall, you can see Luke staying down for a hot second ... before brushing it off with a laugh as he jumped back up 'cause the show must go on, of course!

CHRIS PRATT & KAT SCHWARZENEGGER Home Tear Down Angers Architect's Stans ... But His Daughter Says Chill,"
           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. 
       
           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend. 
       
           As they say, out with the old, in with the new -- even for an Ellwood classic.

How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap‚Ä¶ like THAT?‚Äù wrote Scott on Sunday morning.

           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments. 
       
           Despite the backlash, people are enjoying CB's spill --. the song has nearly 2 million plays on his YouTube channel, and would inevitably rack up more if he put the song on streaming.

CELINE DION GIVES RARE INSIGHT INTO LIFE WITH STIFF-PERSON SYNDROME,"
           Celine Dion  says she's doing all she can to prove nothing can hold her back, even as she copes with Stiff-Person Syndrome ... 2 years on from when she was first diagnosed. 
       
           The icon admits she's upset she hasn't conquered the disease yet -- but, as she provided a rare update about her health to  Vogue France , she insisted she was doing everything in her power to push forward in hopes science will eventually find a cure. 
       
           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery. 
       
           The legend's taking things one day at a time, but she's got her sights set on some big goals ... such as seeing the Eiffel Tower again and hitting the road for another tour. 
       
           Celine empoweringly added, ""There's one thing that will never stop, and that's the will. It's the passion. It's the dream. It's the determination."" 
       
           The ""My Heart Will Go On"" singer was  diagnosed with SPS  in 2022, and her sister previously revealed the autoimmune disorder, at times,  leaves Celine completely immobilized .

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"
           Kim Kardashian 's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. 
       
           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

David Beckham Sues Mark Wahlberg's Co. ... You're Unfit to Make Fitness Deals!!!,"
           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

           A calm yet irritated T-Pain went live from the scene of the accident and pointed out a very valuable clue for police ... the driver had left their bumper in the street, and it was only a matter of time before they matched the silver Chevy with the missing part. 
       
           Turns out he was right ... T-Pain posted an update, letting fans know the driver had been caught, and gauging by his use of the üòà emoji, he plans on showing the guy no mercy. 
       
           He says the principle of the driver not stopping to check on their well-being is what got him hot, although it appeared his own personal driver was headed to the hospital for medical attention. 
       
           The crash forced T-Pain to alter his packed itinerary but something tells us he'll make up for it in legal justice.

NASCAR Massive Crash At Talladega ... Tyler Reddick Ends Up Winning,"
           A brutal crash went down in the closing moments of NASCAR's Geico 500 at Talladega on Sunday ... taking out several cars in the final lap and paving the way for  Tyler Reddick  to come away with the win. 
       
           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega.

           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it!

           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too.

           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury.

           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there.

We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them. 
       
           His new single, ""Stressed Out,"" is probably a fitting description of his mood prior to getting the good news.

Adrien Broner Wants To Fight Devin Haney ... After Ryan Garcia Loss,"
           Adrien Broner   says  Devin Haney   needs him now more than ever -- after suffering the first loss of his career on Saturday -- with AB challenging the 31-1 boxer to a fight! 
       
           34-year-old Broner, 35-4, made a video addressing 25-year-old Haney after Saturday's fight at Barclays in Brooklyn ... one of the most shocking upsets of the year. 
       
           ""I know everybody waiting on my reaction, but I'mma just tell the truth,"" Broner said in an Instagram video. 
       
           ""Ay Devin! You gotta fight me now n****! S***, right now, you need me n****!"" 
       
           The fight offer was followed by some trolling ... AB took a shot at Haney's father,  Bill , who he's had beef with for some time. 
       
           ""Hold on, anybody seen Bill? Where the f*** is Bill at?!"" Broner said. ""Nah, we know where Devin at. Devin probably trying to get his thoughts together and s***. He'll be alright."" 
       
           ""Where the f*** Bill at?! Bill?!"" 
       
           Broner wasn't the only boxer throwing shade at the Haneys ...  Gervonta 'Tank' Davis , the only fighter to beat  Ryan Garcia ,   also trolled Devin and his crew. 
       
           ""Forget Devin.. WHERE BILL AT WHERE DIRT AT!!!!!!!!!"" Davis said on X. ""And what about you d**k riding ass people."" 
       
           ""I‚Äôm still coming to get n***** .. it‚Äôs not over! N***** gotta see me!"" 
       
           And, of course, Garcia -- who was a significant underdog after a bizarre fight camp -- also took shots, too ... saying Haney broke his jaw during the fight. 
       
           Devin said that's fake news ... but,  that loss  on Saturday was all too real. Stay tuned for DH's next move.

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"
           10:16 PM PT  -- A rep for  Kanye West  tells TMZ ... ""'Grabbed' is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted."" 
       
           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

Damian Lillard Estranged Wife Clowns GloRilla ... After DUI Arrest,"
           Damian Lillard 's estranged wife was apparently not a fan of  GloRilla  recently shooting her shot at the NBA superstar ... the hooper's ex clowned the Memphis rapper shortly after she was arrested for DUI. 
       
           GloRilla  was arrested  in Georgia on Tuesday for suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container, as well as another traffic charge. 
       
           Kay'La  -- who was married to Dame from September 2021 until he  filed for divorce  in October 2023 -- saw the legal trouble as an opportunity to roast the rapper ... this after she said she wanted to be with the Milwaukee Bucks guard. 
       
           ""Free GloLillard,"" Kay'La wrote on a photo of Glo's mugshot on Instagram, adding the hashtag, ""#sisterwifeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è""

           ""She mad, hurt, and taking it out on the wrong person,"" a follower commented.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

Dutch Soccer Final Fire Breaks Out Behind Goal ... Game Delayed 30 Minutes,"
           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden . 
       
           It's hard not to remember the break-in at  Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco home back in 2022 ... when her husband  Paul Pelosi  was  bludgeoned with a hammer  by  David DePape . 
       
           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect."" 
       
           We're told LAPD's elite Robbery and Homicide division is investigating the case.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight."" 
       
           It'd be massive ... but first, Saturday night's super fight! üëä

           Ex-NBA hooper and current weed entrepreneur  Al Harrington  has some solid advice for any newbies looking to celebrate the 4/20 holiday this year ... telling  TMZ Sports  it's pretty simple -- ""get high as f***!!!"" 
       
           Harrington knows his stuff -- the guy built an entire company around his love for Mary Jane ... serving as the CEO of the Viola brand. 
       
           He's doing pretty well for himself, too ... with the company valued at over $100 million.

           Harrington has been a huge advocate for the benefits of marijuana -- in 2017, he sat down with former NBA commish  David Stern  ... and the conversation helped the league eventually take weed off the banned substances list. 
       
           As for folks looking to dabble with some doobies, Harrington says there's no need to complicate it ... just puff, puff, pass and enjoy yourself.

           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment.

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

           Of course, Posh herself was there though it seemed she shied away from the camera a bit ... focusing on her guests and hangin' firmly with 12-year-old  Harper  all night.  She's still using crutches  BTW ... after breaking her foot in a gym accident. 
       
           BTW ... all the Beckham kids made it out for their mom's bday -- with her boys  Brooklyn ,  Romeo  and  Cruz  pulling up as one big squad and husband  David Beckham  also attending. 
       
           And, the A-List only begins with the Spice Girls and the Beckhams ... because some of the biggest stars on the planet also showed up for VB's big day. 
       
           Tom Cruise  looked dapper in a tuxedo on the big night, and Gordon Ramsey arrived with wife Tana in tow. 
       
           Among the other bold-faced names ...  Guy Ritchie ,  Jason Statham , Victoria's Secret Angel  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Marc Anthony  and his new wife  Nadia Ferreira ,  Eva Longoria,  and a whole lot more. 
       
           It's a good sign the Beckhams are still throwing parties ... like we told you, investigative biographer,  Tom Bower 's promising a  tell-all book  full of stories about David's rumored affairs -- a glossed-over topic in their Netflix doc. 
       
           Seems the Beckham clan isn't sweating the release though ... and, their longtime friends totally have their back.

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers. 
       
           In 2016, Jenkins tried to latch on with the Cardinals, but he got injured in the preseason ... and never played another down in the NFL again.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

Arnold Schwarzenegger Here's How I Punked Sly Into Starring in Movie Flop!!!,"
           Arnold Schwarzenegger  epically punked  Sylvester Stallone  into signing on for the most disastrous film of Sly's career, and that's exactly what Arnold wanted to happen! 
       
           Arnold and Sly sat down with  Harvey  for a candid, sometimes stunning convo about the intense rivalry between the 2 mega-action stars. 
       
           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played. 
       
           ""TMZ Presents Arnold & Sly: Rivals, Friends, Icons"" airs Tuesday at 8 PM/7 Central on FOX.

"Spring Breakers Can't Stop Brawlin', Trash the Ocean","
           Spring Break reached rowdy new heights outside Savannah, GA ... as several violent fights broke out, despite increased police presence. 
       
           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well."" 
       
           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down.

'90 Day Fianc√©' Liz Slams 'Weakling' Big Ed For Calling Off Wedding!!!,"
           Big Ed Brown  and  Liz Woods  have called it quits again ... and it seems to be for real this time. 
       
           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months. 
       
           Good luck to 'em both ... but we'll miss the drama.

           Ne-Yo  is happily living his truth as a non-monogamous man -- but his R&B OG  Carl Thomas  is forewarning him that 2 heads aren't always better than one!!! 
       
           The ""Because Of You"" singer was turning heads in L.A. yesterday when TMZ Hip Hop caught him at The Grove with both of his girlfriends -- and, though he told us he's not looking to get hitched anytime soon, he IS  loving the lifestyle !!!

           The singer was once a platinum-selling powerhouse on  Diddy 's Bad Boy Records in the early 2000s, when you gotta imagine he had plenty of options in the female department. But, now he's testifying to being a one-woman man, and seems to believe Ne-Yo will eventually narrow down his options too.

           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain't all that. 
       
           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man's new title ... and it's safe to say she's pissed, 'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. 
       
           ""My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met,"" Bonilla said. ""He hasn't stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career."" 
       
           ""It's hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense,"" she added. ""I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind."" 
       
           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run. 
       
           ""I am proud of you, and our son is proud of you."" 
       
           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a ""blessing"" to start a family. 
       
           Something Bonilla will certainly like -- Gobert was just named a finalist for the NBA's DPOY once again this season ... and that award actually means something.

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

Robert Kraft 'Deeply Saddened' By Columbia Univ. ... Cuts Off Funding,"

           ""The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize,"" 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, ""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country."" 
       
           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia's NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. 
       
           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. 
       
           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. 
       
           ""I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution."" 
       
           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he's certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. 
       
           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren't peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. 
       
           ""While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous.""

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"
           Kim Kardashian 's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. 
       
           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

Meek Mill New Hummer EV Almost Killed Me!!! Sticking with Tesla,"
           Meek Mill  is regretting his latest auto purchase ... the ""Dreamchasers"" rapper posted a video of his new Hummer EV vehicle and the evidence is as sour as a lemon!!! 
       
           Back in March, Meek posted a flick of a wrecked GMC but recently revealed how it happened -- he claims the brake pedal fell off, and the car even started driving on him ... while it was in park!!! 
       
           According to Meek, he barely had the whip for 4 hours but witnessed several safety features fail on him, including the airbags ... which he, unfortunately, experienced during the crash!!! 
       
           GMC offered up the typical corporate response and requested Meek send them a DM on X for further info, but Meek might have moved on to other car makers. 
       
           Meek says it was his first non-Tesla electric vehicle and by the sounds of things, he likely won't abandon  Elon Musk 's products again. 
       
           Of course, he might have a similar issue with a Cybertruck, if that's his jam.

Jill Scott Blown Up for Chris Brown Defense ... After His Quavo Attack,"
           Jill Scott  isn't going to let  Chris Brown ‚Äôs checkered past block her enjoyment of listening to him lyrically pummel  Quavo , and she's been fending off critics who wished she didn't cape for Chris!!! 
       
           The ripple effect from Chris' brutal ""Weakest Link"" graced Jill's radar over the weekend and she couldn't help, but gush over the embattled singer's MC skills ... ‚Äú@chrisbrown is amazing. How does ANYBODY sing like THAT? Dance, look, Act and Rap‚Ä¶ like THAT?‚Äù wrote Scott on Sunday morning. 
       
           ‚ÄúBeyond gifted. It appears, exceptional people have to go through exceptional üî•. There‚Äôs nothing to debate.‚Äù 
       
           The praise struck a nerve with fans on X, many felt CB had gone too far on the diss -- especially with his record of domestic violence with  Rihanna . 
       
           Blowback over collabs  is nothing new  to Chris ... but the ferocity of his Quavo diss has fans concerned Jill is instigating future violence. 
       
           Jilly from Philly defended her comments from past experience by using her mother's ex-husband as an example -- she painted him as a ""mean, violent"" abuser who was also celebrated for being a popular bricklayer around the city. 
       
           After much deliberation on Monday, Jill says she gave an open mind to every POV darted at her head ... and is still comfortable with her comments. 
       
           Despite the backlash, people are enjoying CB's spill --. the song has nearly 2 million plays on his YouTube channel, and would inevitably rack up more if he put the song on streaming. 
       
           Quavo is currently on the clock.

Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyonc√© Fans,"
           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

MICHAEL JACKSON NEVERLAND RANCH RESTORED!!! Cameras Roll For Biopic,"
           Michael Jackson 's infamous Neverland theme park is dusting off the cobwebs to film scenes for a new biopic about the late singer's life. 
       
           As you can see in the aerial shots ... the film company behind the biopic has restored signature features from when Jackson owned the 2,700-acre ranch near Santa Barbara -- the Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and circus tent all got colorful makeovers. 
       
           Everything's buzzin' with life and fun at the revamped Neverland Ranch ... with a whole lineup of other fairground rides, such as a hot-air balloon ride and even a red train. 
       
           Filming was in full swing Friday with camera crews set up, and extras fully immersed in their roles as balloon sellers, ride operators, and food stall vendors. 
       
           Michael stopped living at Neverland after 2003, when Sheriff's deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case. Although he never returned, his estate still co-owned the Ranch until 2020 -- that's when  Ron Burkle  -- a Jackson family friend -- purchased it for a reported $22 million. 
       
           The MJ biopic  has his nephew ,  Jaafar Jackson , playing the King of Pop ... and, since the Jackson Estate is behind the film, it will feature loads of Michael's hits. 
       
           A first-look trailer for the movie was unveiled at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel earlier this month -- but hold onto your hats, as it's only halfway through production. 
       
           Fans will have to wait until 2025 until the movie hits theaters.

           A calm yet irritated T-Pain went live from the scene of the accident and pointed out a very valuable clue for police ... the driver had left their bumper in the street, and it was only a matter of time before they matched the silver Chevy with the missing part. 
       
           Turns out he was right ... T-Pain posted an update, letting fans know the driver had been caught, and gauging by his use of the üòà emoji, he plans on showing the guy no mercy. 
       
           He says the principle of the driver not stopping to check on their well-being is what got him hot, although it appeared his own personal driver was headed to the hospital for medical attention. 
       
           The crash forced T-Pain to alter his packed itinerary but something tells us he'll make up for it in legal justice.

           Brittany was spotted on a luxurious yacht with at least four other ladies ... soaking up the sun as they lounged on the back deck. 
       
           Britt rocked a tiny, orange two-piece for the occasion ... which is something she's quite accustomed to lately, as she was named to  SI's newest swimsuit issue  back in February. 
       
           No word on what all the ladies got into ... but chances are they had  Taylor Swift 's new 'Tortured Poets Department' album blaring on the speakers, considering Brittany was  super pumped  for  Travis Kelce 's girlfriend when the project dropped.

           Celine acknowledges she's had serious moments of doubt, saying ... ""I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself. At the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?"" 
       
           She goes on, ""The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it's over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself."" 
       
           Celine explains she chose to work on her body and soul from head to toe ... pouring her all into rigorous athletic, physical and vocal therapy sessions 5 days a week to aid her recovery. 
       
           The legend's taking things one day at a time, but she's got her sights set on some big goals ... such as seeing the Eiffel Tower again and hitting the road for another tour.

           Beyonc√© also appeared to address the backlash she's been getting since announcing the beauty venture back in February. Some fans complained Bey lacks credibility in the hair biz because they hadn't seen enough of her real hair ... as opposed to hair extensions she wears for productions. 
       
           She's clearly heard the criticism, because during the tutorial ... Beyonc√© called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don't have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it ""some bulls**t cause it ain't nobody's business!""

Delta Burke I Tried Crystal Meth to Lose Lbs. ... Didn't Eat for 5 Days!!!,"
           Delta Burke  is revealing the shocking lengths to which she went just to drop a few pounds in her heyday -- using crystal meth as an appetite suppressant! 
       
           The actress -- best known for playing Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"" -- stopped by the ' Glamorous Trash ' podcast and opened up about how the scrutiny over her weight led her to drug use. 
       
           Delta said she was first prescribed weight-loss pills while in acting school in London, but later learned the prescription was illegal in the States -- so, she had someone get her similar pills while she starred in ""Filthy Rich"" between 1982 and 1983. 
       
           The pills, which she called ""Black Beauties,"" helped curb her appetite during the day, but she says she eventually built up a tolerance. 
       
           That's when a coworker suggested she try methamphetamine ... and she did!!! 
       
           She added ... ""[They told me], 'You chop it up. You snort.' I said, I don't want to snort it. So I put it in cranberry juice and [drank] it ‚Ä¶ and wouldn't eat for 5 days."" 
       
           Despite her attempts to lose weight, Delta recalled still being criticized for her body, which greatly impacted her mental health ... and even led to her early exit from 'DW.' 
       
           While Delta's admission might seem shocking, she isn't the first celeb to seek drug assistance in order to achieve a body transformation.

           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it.

           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. 
       
           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. 
       
           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. 
       
           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . 
       
           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. 
       
           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. 
       
           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. 
       
           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend.

           The pioneering hip hop duo was on the ballot for this year's induction, but came up short in the final vote. Instead,  Mary J. Blige ,  Cher , Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner,  Peter Frampton , Kool & The Gang,  Ozzy Osbourne  and A Tribe Called Quest will be entering the Hall. 
       
           However, the two legends want it to be clear there are no hard feelings on their part, as they're happily congratulating their peers who will be inducted. 
       
           Eric B & Rakim tell TMZ Hip Hop ... ""Congratulations to the diverse group of artists inducted into the Rock Hall this year. Seeing Tribe and Mary on the list besides Cher, Ozzy, Kool and the Gang and all of the other icons shows how inclusive the institution has become."" 
       
           Though, Eric B. and Rakim are still eyeing the honor for themselves at some point. They add ... ""Keep voting ... we'll join you soon!""

           The duo was named on the nominations list alongside a diverse group of performers, and as far as the acts that didn't get in this year, they're in excellent company --  Mariah Carey , Jane‚Äôs Addiction,  Sade ,  Sinead O‚ÄôConnor , Oasis and  Lenny Kravitz  will all have to wait for another chance to join the Hall of Fame party.

           TMZ Hip Hop caught up with the ""Right Thurr"" rapper ahead of the debut of his ""Unsung"" episode on TV One. He's on his ""Nu Beginnings"" wave courtesy of his brand-new single released today, but still has a sour taste in his mouth over the  Sidney Starr  situation  he says  killed his career climb. 
       
           Chingy recalls being blackballed when Sidney, a transgender model, lied about sleeping with him back in the day, and tells us her eventual apology barely did any real damage control. 
       
           The St. Louis rapper came out the gate with a multi-platinum debut in 2003, and put many bullets on the Billboard charts. 
       
           However, he says he saw, firsthand, how easily fans can forget about you when the mainstream machine isn't pumping your product. 
       
           Speaking of the mainstream, Chingy also fears  Drake  and  Kendrick Lamar 's  current clash  is getting way too intense ... and the back-and-forth stingers could escalate to violence if they're not careful. 
       
           Rap hasn't been keeping the peace as of late, but Chingy feels it can be done.

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

"Kanye West Jumping Into Rap Beef ... Drops Drake, J. Cole Diss","
           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"
           9:45 AM PT  --  Kid Cudi  just posted a video update detailing what happened during his jump offstage, ""This is what happens when a 40-year-old man tries to prance around off stage like he's 26."" 
       
           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

           Breakout New York City rapper  Sugarhill Ddot  has collected millions of streams for his music at just 16 years old but the hip hop landscape is changing ... all the top guys are beefing!!! 
       
           Ddot tells TMZ Hip Hop seeing  Drake   vs.  Kendrick Lamar  vs.  Rick Ross , etc. isn't the game he thought he signed up for ... their antics taught him to avoid that route when it comes to his generation. 
       
           He's one of the handful of youngins revamping the NYC Drill sound for a new era, carrying on the tradition started by Sugarhill Gang's iconic record ""Rapper's Delight"" decades before he was born. 
       
           Drake and Kendrick's beef is cooking itself so we also gave Ddot the floor to shoot his shot ... and he fired two guns 'ablazin' in  Rubi Rose 's direction!!! 
       
           He's still a couple years out before Rubi can legally entertain the inquiry ... but he's going for it anyway. 
       
           At any rate, Ddot tells us he'd rather see Drake & Co. unified than ripping each other apart on the 'Gram. 
       
           Hip Hop got Ddot off the streets ... he wants to keep it that way.

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

Nicki Minaj Almost Nailed by Object ... Hurls it Back Into Crowd!!!,"
           Nicki Minaj  will not stand for objects being thrown at her -- giving one concertgoer a taste of their own medicine. 
       
           Check it out .. during a performance of her hit song ""Starships,"" the rapper swats away an item as it flies toward her face. Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. 
       
           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. 
       
           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows. 
       
           We're not sure why this trend is growing ... but celebs are def over it!!!

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

Jake Plummer Down For Pat Tillman HOF Honor ... But I Know His Legacy Will Go On Regardless,"

           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too. 
       
           ""I think about him a lot,"" Jake said, ""and I know he's inspiring a lot of people to be better."" 
       
           We discussed Pat's legacy on a previous episode of  Last Days , available on all podcast platforms.

           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega. 
       
           Michael Jordan  was proud of his driver's crazy win ... and celebrated with his family, including Reddick's son.

           Arnold's trainer and compadre, bodybuilding legend  Franco Columbu , trained Sly for ""Rocky II,"" and when Franco challenged Sly to a bench press competition, the actor was game ... until he ripped his pec off the bone. 
       
           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury. 
       
           As Sly put it to us ... pushing through the pain is just what driven folks like Arnold and himself did to make it to the top.

           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on.

           83-year-old Rose also signed ... ""I WISH I HAD AN INTERPRETER"" 
       
           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it. 
       
           Major League Baseball has pressed pause on their investigation, opting to wait until Mizuhara's criminal case is closed, to determine if they'll investigate Ohtani, or anyone else involved, any further.

           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

Adrien Broner Wants To Fight Devin Haney ... After Ryan Garcia Loss,"
           Adrien Broner   says  Devin Haney   needs him now more than ever -- after suffering the first loss of his career on Saturday -- with AB challenging the 31-1 boxer to a fight! 
       
           34-year-old Broner, 35-4, made a video addressing 25-year-old Haney after Saturday's fight at Barclays in Brooklyn ... one of the most shocking upsets of the year. 
       
           ""I know everybody waiting on my reaction, but I'mma just tell the truth,"" Broner said in an Instagram video. 
       
           ""Ay Devin! You gotta fight me now n****! S***, right now, you need me n****!"" 
       
           The fight offer was followed by some trolling ... AB took a shot at Haney's father,  Bill , who he's had beef with for some time. 
       
           ""Hold on, anybody seen Bill? Where the f*** is Bill at?!"" Broner said. ""Nah, we know where Devin at. Devin probably trying to get his thoughts together and s***. He'll be alright."" 
       
           ""Where the f*** Bill at?! Bill?!"" 
       
           Broner wasn't the only boxer throwing shade at the Haneys ...  Gervonta 'Tank' Davis , the only fighter to beat  Ryan Garcia ,   also trolled Devin and his crew. 
       
           ""Forget Devin.. WHERE BILL AT WHERE DIRT AT!!!!!!!!!"" Davis said on X. ""And what about you d**k riding ass people."" 
       
           ""I‚Äôm still coming to get n***** .. it‚Äôs not over! N***** gotta see me!"" 
       
           And, of course, Garcia -- who was a significant underdog after a bizarre fight camp -- also took shots, too ... saying Haney broke his jaw during the fight. 
       
           Devin said that's fake news ... but,  that loss  on Saturday was all too real. Stay tuned for DH's next move.

Matt Ryan Former NFL MVP Retires At 38,"
           Matty Ice is putting his career on ice for good -- former NFL MVP  Matt Ryan  is officially retiring from professional football after 15 seasons. 
       
           The Atlanta Falcons great -- who played all but one season with the organization -- released a heartfelt goodbye to the game on Monday ... saying it was time to hang up the helmet. 
       
           ""Today, 16 years after being drafted, my childhood dream has officially come to an end,"" Ryan said. 
       
           ""I'm honored to retire as a Falcon."" 
       
           Ryan -- the third overall pick in 2008 -- played his best season in 2016 ... leading the league in passer rating and being named first-team All-Pro. 
       
           He threw for nearly 63,000 yards during his time under center ... and had 381 touchdowns and just 183 interceptions. 
       
           Ryan -- the franchise's all-time wins leader for a quarterback -- led the Falcons to a NFC Championship in 2017. 
       
           Ryan shouted out several members of the Falcons organization ... including owner  Arthur Blank  and teammates like  Tony Gonzalez ,  Michael Turner ,  Roddy White  and, of course,  Julio Jones . 
       
           ""I truly believe that football life is not simple about what you do but rather who you do it with and I was a better player because of the people I was surrounded by,"" Ryan added. 
       
           The four-time Pro Bowler played his final season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2022 ... going 4-7-1 in 12 games. 
       
           He spent the 2023 campaign working for CBS on NFL Sundays. 
       
           Congrats on retirement, Matty Ice!!

Dwyane Wade 'High Dining' For Best Buds ... Gabrielle Makes Magic!!!,"
           Dwyane Wade 's annual ""High Dining"" dinner, in honor of 420, went down with several of the NBA great's famous pals rolling up to join the festivities -- including a few surprises. 
       
           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they've made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. 
       
           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities. 
       
           His wife  Gabrielle Union  stood in as magician  Kevin Li 's assistant -- thankfully everyone kept their hands to themselves, and no one was sliced and diced on the table. üëÄ 
       
           The event also debuted Jeeter and the  Bob Marley  estate's master collaboration -- a 4.2-gram pre-roll packaged in a guitar case ... in other words, a Jah-endorsed rollout! 
       
           Bob's grandson, Grammy-nominated singer  Skip Marley  also performed ""Jamming"" and ""One Love"" -- and the significance of having the latest generation of Marley hitmakers present needed no explanation.

Rudy Gobert Partner Defends NBA Star After Vote ... He's Not Overrated To Me!!!,"
           Some NBA hoopers think  Rudy Gobert   is the most overrated player in the league ... but his partner,  Julia Bonilla , says those guys are dead wrong -- passionately defending the Minnesota Timberwolves star on social media. 
       
           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain't all that. 
       
           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man's new title ... and it's safe to say she's pissed, 'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. 
       
           ""My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met,"" Bonilla said. ""He hasn't stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career."" 
       
           ""It's hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense,"" she added. ""I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind."" 
       
           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she's pulling for her man's team throughout the run. 
       
           ""I am proud of you, and our son is proud of you."" 
       
           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a ""blessing"" to start a family. 
       
           Something Bonilla will certainly like -- Gobert was just named a finalist for the NBA's DPOY once again this season ... and that award actually means something.

"Busta Rhymes Phones Down, and Put Ya Hands Where My Eyes Can See!!!","
           Busta Rhymes  ain't about to stomach Hollywood-type crowds at his performance -- even if the gig happens to be in the Hollywood Hills!!! 
       
           That was the plotline when  Dwyane Wade  and cannabis co. Jeeter recruited Bussa Bus to perform at the after-party of their 420 ""High Dining"" event ... and while he was trying to do his duty, he wasn't getting high vibes from the crowd. 
       
           Basically, the audience wasn't giving Busta the energy he felt his classic tune ""Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See"" deserved -- so, he cut the music and told the onlookers to get their minds right. 
       
           Busta says he, along with  Spliff Star  and  DJ Scratchator , have been ripping mics since childhood, and he'll be damned if anyone doesn't respect his hip hop hierarchy!!! 
       
           The audience woke up for take 2, and Busta wooed the fans before getting a surprise of his own -- Team Jeeter crafted a new cannabis strain in Busta's honor, adding him to the family alongside D. Wade.

Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!,"
           4:37 PM PT --  Bam Margera  just posted video to Instagram showing a portion of the attempts he says he made to call 911 for police assistance last week ... recorded before he ended up taking matters into his own hands, fighting off a threatening stranger. 
       
           Bam's obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. 
       
           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           ICYMI ... the video shows the 'Jackass' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip's making the rounds online and has many of Bam's fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he's calling his latest ink job ""highway robbery"" -- but we're told this is an entirely separate incident. 
       
           Bam's manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ ‚Ä¶ the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. 
       
           Mike adds, ""This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke."" 
       
           We're told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam's camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. 
       
           Bam tells us ... ""I'm not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew."" 
       
           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. 
       
           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. 
       
           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam.

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden . 
       
           It's hard not to remember the break-in at  Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco home back in 2022 ... when her husband  Paul Pelosi  was  bludgeoned with a hammer  by  David DePape . 
       
           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect."" 
       
           We're told LAPD's elite Robbery and Homicide division is investigating the case.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

Sydney Sweeney Boasts About Her 'Great T**s' .... After Producer Criticized Her Looks,"
           Sydney Sweeney  ain't sweatin' the harsh criticism she received from a veteran Hollywood producer about her acting skills and physical appearance. 
       
           On Sunday, the actress posted a series of photos and a video to Instagram, showing her having fun in the sun with friends during an exotic getaway with a caption that read: ""good times and tan lines."" 
       
           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?"" 
       
           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney's rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers."" 
       
           Clearly, Sydney isn't bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she's having the last laugh.

           Thousands flocked to Tybee Island this past weekend for the annual Orange Crush gathering ... and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue. Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. 
       
           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. 
       
           Partygoers also trashed the island's picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. 
       
           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. 
       
           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. 
       
           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... ""We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there‚Äôs a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well.""

'90 Day Fianc√©' Liz Slams 'Weakling' Big Ed For Calling Off Wedding!!!,"
           Big Ed Brown  and  Liz Woods  have called it quits again ... and it seems to be for real this time. 
       
           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months. 
       
           Good luck to 'em both ... but we'll miss the drama.

           Drake says Hed is being used as a blind spokesperson as Kendrick's team scrambles for answers to ""Push Ups"" -- basically, he thinks the silence is deafening!!!

Dutch Soccer Final Fire Breaks Out Behind Goal ... Game Delayed 30 Minutes,"
           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

           He's thinking like a boss more than ever. YG and his label recently inked a multi-album partnership deal with BMG, after officially departing Def Jam Records -- so, more than ever, his career is his to control.

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"
           10:16 PM PT  -- A rep for  Kanye West  tells TMZ ... ""'Grabbed' is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted."" 
       
           They add, ""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted."" 
       
           Kanye West might have new legal trouble on his hands -- he's the named suspect in a battery report, and cops are now looking into the claims against him ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

Damian Lillard Estranged Wife Clowns GloRilla ... After DUI Arrest,"
           Damian Lillard 's estranged wife was apparently not a fan of  GloRilla  recently shooting her shot at the NBA superstar ... the hooper's ex clowned the Memphis rapper shortly after she was arrested for DUI. 
       
           GloRilla  was arrested  in Georgia on Tuesday for suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container, as well as another traffic charge. 
       
           Kay'La  -- who was married to Dame from September 2021 until he  filed for divorce  in October 2023 -- saw the legal trouble as an opportunity to roast the rapper ... this after she said she wanted to be with the Milwaukee Bucks guard. 
       
           ""Free GloLillard,"" Kay'La wrote on a photo of Glo's mugshot on Instagram, adding the hashtag, ""#sisterwifeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"" 
       
           Fans instantly caught on to the shade ... and had plenty to say about the cryptic message. 
       
           ""She mad, hurt, and taking it out on the wrong person,"" a follower commented. 
       
           Others believe Kay'La -- who has three kids with Lillard -- was joking ... with most people feeling she missed the mark. 
       
           Another wrote ... ""Didn‚Äôt he file for a divorce üò©üò© this is cringey af."" 
       
           Glo, nor Dame, has responded ... not surprising given the hooper has an NBA playoff series coming up.

           Kodak Black  can now place his recent drug possession case in his rearview mirror ... the last significant charge in the case was tossed out this week!!! 
       
           Court docs obtained by TMZ Hip Hop show a judge just dismissed the remaining tampering charge against the Florida rapper -- this after previously tossing the drug possession charges, back in February, after Kodak showed he had a prescription for the drugs. 
       
           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them. 
       
           His new single, ""Stressed Out,"" is probably a fitting description of his mood prior to getting the good news.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           In his latest IG post, Drake somehow dug up a photo of Kendrick's manager  Anthony Saleh  poppin' tags shopping at one of the rap megastar's OVO stores. 
       
           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

Kanye & Bianca Out For An Afternoon Drive ... Battery Report No Big Deal,"
           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

Ne-Yo Gets Warning from Carl Thomas ... Throuple Not All It's Cracked Up to Be!!!,"
           Ne-Yo  is happily living his truth as a non-monogamous man -- but his R&B OG  Carl Thomas  is forewarning him that 2 heads aren't always better than one!!! 
       
           The ""Because Of You"" singer was turning heads in L.A. yesterday when TMZ Hip Hop caught him at The Grove with both of his girlfriends -- and, though he told us he's not looking to get hitched anytime soon, he IS  loving the lifestyle !!! 
       
           Carl's a little older than Ne-Yo but added his own 2 cents to the convo after The Shade Room reposted our clip -- he says he once entertained a throuple situation but says time and wisdom changed his ways. 
       
           The singer was once a platinum-selling powerhouse on  Diddy 's Bad Boy Records in the early 2000s, when you gotta imagine he had plenty of options in the female department. But, now he's testifying to being a one-woman man, and seems to believe Ne-Yo will eventually narrow down his options too. 
       
           Ne-Yo's fresh off  a divorce , and told us everyone's situation varies.

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

Shakur Stevenson Ryan Garcia Won't Beat Devin Haney He's Not Focused On Fight!,"
           Ryan Garcia  is not taking the  Devin Haney  fight seriously ... and because of that, the 24-1 boxer will suffer the 2nd loss of his career -- at least that's the way fellow star fighter  Shakur Stevenson   sees it! 
       
           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight."" 
       
           It'd be massive ... but first, Saturday night's super fight! üëä

Al Harrington My 4/20 Advice ... 'Get High As F***!!!',"
           Ex-NBA hooper and current weed entrepreneur  Al Harrington  has some solid advice for any newbies looking to celebrate the 4/20 holiday this year ... telling  TMZ Sports  it's pretty simple -- ""get high as f***!!!"" 
       
           Harrington knows his stuff -- the guy built an entire company around his love for Mary Jane ... serving as the CEO of the Viola brand. 
       
           He's doing pretty well for himself, too ... with the company valued at over $100 million. 
       
           Harrington -- who played 16 seasons in the league for a number of teams -- told us he'll be in NYC for a three-day ""4/20 Tour"" this weekend ... 'cause apparently, the dude needs way more than 24 hours to show his love for cannabis. 
       
           Harrington has been a huge advocate for the benefits of marijuana -- in 2017, he sat down with former NBA commish  David Stern  ... and the conversation helped the league eventually take weed off the banned substances list. 
       
           As for folks looking to dabble with some doobies, Harrington says there's no need to complicate it ... just puff, puff, pass and enjoy yourself.

O.J. SIMPSON BANK OF AMERICA CREDIT CARD Up for AUCTION,"
           O.J. Simpson 's Bank of America credit card has hit the auction block ... and let's just say the seller is banking on it raking in some serious cash. 
       
           Jonathan Lepore  is selling the business account card over at  Goldin Auctions  ... telling TMZ he snagged the piece of plastic, which expired in 2023, on eBay last summer for a steal at $70, adding it to his trove of sports memorabilia. 
       
           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

Taylor Swift Smooches Travis Kelce In 'Fortnight' Vid,"
           Taylor Swift  can't hide she's totally smitten with BF  Travis Kelce  in her new YouTube promotional clip for her first music video, ""Fortnight,"" off her recently released 11th album. 
       
           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment. 
       
           But Taylor's not giving any love to her ex  Joe Alwyn  on her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" which was officially released Friday. 
       
           In one song, ""So Long London,"" Taylor  rips into Alwyn  for his alleged depression, which she seemingly attributes to their break-up. 
       
           Taylor also took a major shot at  Kim Kardashian  in another tune, 'thanK you aIMee,""  comparing the reality star to a schoolyard bully  and reigniting their feud from years ago.

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence. 
       
           Looks like Jim's tuning out the haters though ... proudly brandishing his team's accomplishment in a permanent way.

           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad. 
       
           While, of course, he loves his father and respects the hell out of the legacy the football legend left with the 49ers -- he says he's determined to build his own name ... and not ride on anyone's coattails. 
       
           In fact, the 22-year-old ex-Trojans star says there's absolutely no chance he wears Dad's No. 80 -- just to make it crystal clear he's Brenden, not Jerry. 
       
           ""I would love to go ahead and make my own impact,"" he said. 
       
           As for off the field, Brenden doesn't mind being like pops there ... because he just teamed up with Breathe Right to recreate the famous ""Air Jerry"" ad that the elder Rice was a part of in his heyday.

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!
