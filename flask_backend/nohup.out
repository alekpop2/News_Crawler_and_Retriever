{'title': 'Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyoncé Fans', 'text': '\n           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, "damned if ya do, damned if ya don\'t" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyoncé  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive\'s pissed. \n       \n           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post\'s tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. \n       \n           After the release of "Fortnight" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, "It’s once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey \U0001f979 I love you so much. Thank you Tay 💕" \n       \n           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, "LEVII\'S JEANS" -- from the "Cowboy Carter" album -- his caption was a more simple, "i love you @beyonce." \n       \n           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyoncé, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! \n       \n           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, "Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god\'s sake." \n       \n           Another added ... "you are acting like as if he’s cursing on beyoncé or he said something bad like.. i don’t see any problem at all." \n       \n           Still, others felt Post\'s performance on Beyoncé\'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. \n       \n           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other\'s movie premieres  last year \xa0... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. \n       \n           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you\'re among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer. \n      '}

Others have called on Kim\'s momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family\'s Hulu show. \n       \n           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim\'s radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. \n       \n           Taylor has made it no secret she\'s still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her \'TIME\' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. \n       \n           She said ... "You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before." \n       \n           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in \'aIMee.\' \n       \n           There\'s no forgiving and forgetting here. \n      '}

There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. \n       \n           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella\'s future. \n      '}

Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. \n       \n           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. \n       \n           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. \n       \n           “Taylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,” Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. \n       \n           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music.

In the opening track "Fortnight," fans picked up on a lyric that paints her (or whoever she\'s singing as) as an alky during this time. \n       \n           Taylor sings ... "I was supposed to be sent away / But they forgot to come and get me / I was a functioning alcoholic \'til nobody noticed my new aesthetic. All of this to say, I hope you\'re okay / But you\'re the reason / And no one here\'s to blame / But what about your quiet treason?" \n       \n           Taylor doesn\'t provide any more insight into this on the song ... as a result, we really don\'t know if she\'s being literal, or simply metaphoric. What\'s interesting ... she notably quit drinking in the months leading up to her "Eras" tour -- that\'s what she told  TIME  Magazine anyway. \n       \n           She previously told TIME she had to ditch her "frat guy" ways while on tour ... choosing instead to prioritize working out and a sober lifestyle so that she could be in tip-top shape for her nearly 4-hour concerts. \n       \n           While Taylor might\'ve not been boozing toward the beginning of her "Eras" tour -- that didn\'t last too long ... because as we\'ve seen over the past several months ... Taylor has often had a drink on her for various occasions, especially when around  Travis Kelce . \n       \n           We\'ve seen Taylor pounding beers and other alcoholic beverages at various football games she\'s been to while  watching her boyfriend play  ... and that was definitely on display during the Super Bowl as well, where she was  having the time of her life  ... with a cup in hand. \n       \n           Even during Taylor\'s  Bahamas vacay with Travis , she was in the water while holding a cocktail -- and this past  weekend at Coachella , folks noticed she appeared to be inebriated there too ... with lip-readers saying they saw her apologizing to TK for being drunk. \n       \n           At just about every big public event Taylor\'s been to of late ... she\'s often seen drinking -- including for all the  Super Bowl after-parties , where she was raging with the team. \n       \n           "Drunk Taylor" was also  trending during the 2023 VMAs  after fans thought the singer had a buzz on at the awards show ... so yeah, it\'s definitely something people notice about her. \n       \n           Interestingly enough, she also seems to be aware of it -- although, in the song, she\'s talking about being an "alcoholic" in the past tense ... so, presumably, that means she used to drink even more ... again, assuming this is meant to be interpreted down to the letter. \n       \n           Taylor has never looked too out of control, FWIW -- while she certainly likes to have a good time, and even a boozy time here and there, there\'s never been any outward signs that she doesn\'t know how to control herself ... or that this is actually a real issue. \n       \n           Still, fans have raised eyebrows over her new alcohol comment ... and it\'s got folks talking. \n      '}

The reason this even had to be addressed is because folks were running rampant with rumors that they'd thrown in the towel recently. \n       \n           There were definitely indications there, perhaps, was trouble in paradise ... including the fact that they'd recently unfollowed each other on Instagram, which is kind of a big deal in 2024. \n       \n           Not just that, but people noticed they seem to have scrubbed most of their pics as a pair. \n       \n           Lastly, there's the fact Halle was just at Coachella last weekend to support her big sister,  Chloe , during her performance ... and DDG was noticeably absent, both in shots Halle posted herself and in footage of Halle watching Chloe's set. She looked to be all by her lonesome. \n       \n           We asked Halle's rep about the unfollowing on IG, but haven't gotten an answer on that just yet. Still, her team is firm and clear with us -- saying they're still going strong, even now. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this was a huge deal is because Halle and DDG  recently welcomed a baby  into the world together ... and they were one of Hollywood's most beloved couples. \n       \n           Halle hasn't posted the kid's face just yet -- but she has been teasing him in a bunch of shots online ... including one she threw up just a couple weeks ago, which also featured DDG in what appears to be a sweet family photo. They were vacationing together, it seems. \n       \n           Halle also recently included DDG in a photo dump to celebrate her 24th birthday. \n       \n           The last time we saw Halle and DDG together in public was back in March, where they posed together in front of cameras for an event. \n       \n           DDG and Halle themselves haven't addressed all the speculation personally ... but her camp is speaking for her now, and they're saying this is all much ado about nothing. End of story. \n      "}

Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to.

The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. \n       \n           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. \n       \n           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. \n       \n           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. \n       \n           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. \n       \n           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet. \n      "}

Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. \n       \n           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. \n       \n           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. \n       \n           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges.

They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n      '}

That wasn\'t just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury. \n       \n           As Sly put it to us ... pushing through the pain is just what driven folks like Arnold and himself did to make it to the top. \n       \n           "TMZ Presents Arnold & Sly: Rivals, Friends, Icons" airs Tuesday at 8/7 Central on FOX. \n      '}

Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. \n       \n           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. \n       \n           He says, "I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I’m sorry like it’s always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that’s how the last 14 breakups have been." \n       \n           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren\'t meant to be. \n       \n           While Ed shares his reasoning with the \'90 Day\' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fiancé\'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. \n       \n           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed\'s cold feet for the whole situation. \n       \n           Liz slams Ed as a "coward" and a "weakling" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, "I don\'t think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me." \n       \n           As for whether Liz and Ed\'s 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed\'s Instagram in recent months. \n       \n           Good luck to \'em both ... but we\'ll miss the drama. \n      '}

Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it\'s enough to trigger the hefty fine. \n       \n           Lana\'s weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, "I LUV IT." \n       \n           However, we\'re told this is the only fine from the music festival\'s 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. \n       \n           The $28K is a huge difference from last year\'s curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines .

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ...

As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

But Won't Blame Diddy", 'text': "\n           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, \xa0-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. \n       \n           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. \n       \n           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. \n       \n           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. \n       \n           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. \n       \n           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting \xa0... and like we said, he served time. \n       \n           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. \n       \n           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. \n       \n           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

{'title': 'Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!', 'text': '\n           Bam Margera  recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n      '}

Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution." \n       \n           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he\'s certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. \n       \n           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. \n       \n           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. \n       \n           Cudi  said , "Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. 🤦🏾\u200d♂️ just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big." \n       \n           Though Kid Cudi\'s set ended early, the crowd wasn\'t too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. \n       \n           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi\'s injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, "Pursuit of Happiness," to make up for his absence. \n       \n           KC couldn\'t say goodbye to his fans \xa0... some of whom seemed super confused. \n       \n           This was Kid Cudi\'s first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it\'s a bummer. \n       \n           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!! \n       \n           Originally Published -- 6:35 AM PT \n      '}

Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. \n       \n           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. \n       \n           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. \n       \n           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. \n       \n           Still, there\'s been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. \n       \n           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom\'s ashes  onstage. \n       \n           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. \n       \n           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows. \n       \n           We\'re not sure why this trend is growing ... but celebs are def over it!!! \n      '}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West\'s wife,  Bianca Censori . \n       \n           We\'re told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. \n       \n           We\'re told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. \n       \n           This isn\'t the first time Ye\'s found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog\'s phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn\'t charged. \n       \n           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying "I\'m going to make a f***ing example of you." \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to Kanye\'s team ... so far, no word back. \n       \n           Originally Published -- 9:00 PM PT \n      '}

Videos from the party weekend show countless intoxicated attendees doing everything from littering to fighting. \n       \n           Check it out ... a group of women are seen wailing on each other, with one fighter ripping the bathing suit top off another. Few intervene in the brawl ... choosing instead to film the fight on their respective phones. \n       \n           Partygoers also trashed the island\'s picturesque beaches ... as large amounts of garbage notably made its way into the ocean after being discarded on the sand. \n       \n           Heading into the Spring Break weekend, Tybee Island increased its police presence ... with cops stationed at all road points. Remember, Savannah State University severed its ties with Orange Crush in 1991 after violent incidents and a drowning tainted the festival. \n       \n           The party weekend returned in 2020 ... before taking another hiatus sparked by the pandemic. Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. \n       \n           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... "We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there’s a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well." \n       \n           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down. \n      '}

See the documentation of the 'REQUEST_FINGERPRINTER_IMPLEMENTATION' setting for information on how to handle this deprecation.

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ...

As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward.

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. \n       \n           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

But Won't Blame Diddy", 'text': "\n           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, \xa0-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. \n       \n           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. \n       \n           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. \n       \n           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. \n       \n           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. \n       \n           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting \xa0... and like we said, he served time. \n       \n           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. \n       \n           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. \n       \n           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

Beyoncé called out the misconception that people who wear wigs and extensions don\'t have long and healthy hair underneath, labeling it "some bulls**t cause it ain\'t nobody\'s business!" \n       \n           Beyoncé\'s dad,  Mathew Knowles , already stepped up to back his daughter ... telling TMZ she definitely knows a thing or 2 about  keeping hair happy and healthy , considering he and   Tina Knowles  ran a successful salon in Houston for nearly 2 decades. \n       \n           And, judging by Bey\'s hair care routine, looks like her products are totally making waves. Now, will that be enough to silence the hate? Of course not. \n      '}

{'title': 'Bam Margera Throws Punches in Street Fight Video ... Claims Self-Defense!!!', 'text': '\n           Bam Margera  recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

Cole\'s hit song "First Person Shooter," igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. \n       \n           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it\'s unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. \n       \n           But, assuming it\'s real ...

No One's Reached Out!!!", 'text': '\n           David Zucker \'s not excited about "The Naked Gun" remake ... saying he\'s not involved with the project, and he\'s worried the team behind it doesn\'t realize how difficult the spoof is. \n       \n           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like \'Naked Gun\' and "Airplane!" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn\'t know how it\'s going to turn out \'cause no one\'s reaching out to him. \n       \n           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. \n       \n           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven\'t even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. \n       \n           As for how they\'ll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn\'t rocket science, but it sure ain\'t easy -- adding he often says, "Don\'t try this at home" when it comes to this style. \n       \n           And, David says he\'s not convinced a remake\'s necessary -- \'cause younger generations are already finding movies like \'Naked Gun,\' "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" and more on their own. \n       \n           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker\'s thoughts on  O.J. Simpson \'s acting in \'Naked Gun\' -- and, you can see the comedy legend\'s still got it! \n       \n           News of the \'Naked Gun\' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/\'SNL\' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. \n       \n           In any case, Zucker\'s skeptical about the project ... unsure if it\'ll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely. \n      '}

Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution." \n       \n           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he\'s certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

Taylor\'s new song, "thanK you aIMee," is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title.

"Finally someone stood up to Aimee." \n       \n           Another said Kim should\'ve apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . \n       \n           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim\'s fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul\'s fame.

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

It wasn\'t hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they\'ve made it official. \n       \n           The family news has been a long time coming -- the couple initially started dating in 2003!!! \n       \n           We got soon-to-be uncle  Ja Rule  to give Ashanti and Nelly  some parenting advice  not too long ago. Doing his best Hallmark card impression, Ja told us the main ingredient for a healthy family recipe is love. \n       \n           Congratulations to the happy couple!

Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet.

Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to.

The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. \n       \n           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! \n       \n           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. \n       \n           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward. \n      "}

Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day.

"R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead" -- so yeah, Brown\'s taking the kid gloves off. \n       \n           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. \n       \n           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. \n       \n           Brown\'s got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo\'s past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. \n       \n           It\'s not clear who Brown\'s talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. \n       \n           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song "Freak"  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown\'s violence  against women. \n       \n           Bottom line ... this beef\'s getting serious -- and, it\'s Quavo\'s move. \n      '}

Cole Diss', 'text': '\n           Kanye West \'s jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar \'s diss track "Like That" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . \n       \n           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled "Like That (Remix)" -- on an episode of "The Download" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. \n       \n           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  "Like That"  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole\'s hit song "First Person Shooter," igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. \n       \n           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it\'s unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. \n       \n           But, assuming it\'s real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, "Y\'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can\'t even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times." \n       \n           Not really a line that\'s up for interpretation here ... Ye\'s taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn\'t miss. \n       \n           And, Ye\'s not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he\'s feeding into the frenzy. \n       \n           He\'s also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. \n       \n           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don\'t know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye\'s back in these rapper\'s good graces. \n       \n           Either way, it\'s a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake\'s history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! 👀 \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n       \n           Originally Published -- 3:30 PM PT \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

Similarly, in 2022, the festival\'s 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. \n       \n           Still, from what we\'ve been told, this year\'s event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. \n       \n           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. \n       \n           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year\'s event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. \n       \n           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella\'s future. \n      '}

Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet.

Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to.

Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. \n       \n           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. \n       \n           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. \n       \n           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting \xa0... and like we said, he served time. \n       \n           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. \n       \n           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. \n       \n           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been." \n       \n           Shakur says he won\'t be in the building for the fight, but he\'s eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he\'s very hopeful he\'ll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that\'ll pit them against each other in the near future. \n       \n           "I see myself fighting Devin.

Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. \n       \n           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength.

Famous Restaurateurs', 'text': '\n           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we\'re told he hit the wrong one. \n       \n           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye\'s team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. \n       \n           Here\'s what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. \n       \n           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella\'s future. \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. \n       \n           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song.

The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. \n       \n           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. \n       \n           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. \n       \n           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. \n       \n           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. \n       \n           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now.

They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

"Finally someone stood up to Aimee." \n       \n           Another said Kim should\'ve apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . \n       \n           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim\'s fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul\'s fame. Others have called on Kim\'s momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family\'s Hulu show. \n       \n           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim\'s radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. \n       \n           Taylor has made it no secret she\'s still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her \'TIME\' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. \n       \n           She said ... "You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before." \n       \n           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in \'aIMee.\' \n       \n           There\'s no forgiving and forgetting here. \n      '}

He's Not Overrated To Me!!!", 'text': '\n           Some NBA hoopers think  Rudy Gobert   is the most overrated player in the league ... but his partner,  Julia Bonilla , says those guys are dead wrong -- passionately defending the Minnesota Timberwolves star on social media. \n       \n           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain\'t all that. \n       \n           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man\'s new title ... and it\'s safe to say she\'s pissed, \'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. \n       \n           "My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met," Bonilla said. "He hasn\'t stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career." \n       \n           "It\'s hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense," she added.

Now Orange Crush is back -- seemingly wilder than ever ... with tens of thousands of people overrunning the 3-mile island. \n       \n           Major  Bob Holley  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources tried to paint a more peaceful picture of the weekend. He told  WSAV3  ... "We have a little bit heavier of a presence, which gives a little bit of a safer environment for people. I think when there’s a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well." \n       \n           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down. \n      '}

From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. \n       \n           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed\'s cold feet for the whole situation. \n       \n           Liz slams Ed as a "coward" and a "weakling" for the way he went about canceling their wedding.

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ...

As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. \n       \n           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. \n       \n           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. \n       \n           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. \n       \n           Still, there\'s been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years.

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. \n       \n           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

Cuts Off Funding", 'text': '\n           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in \'63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn\'t going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. \n       \n           "The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize," 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, "I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country." \n       \n           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia\'s NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution." \n       \n           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he\'s certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

Taylor\'s new song, "thanK you aIMee," is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a "bronze spray-tanned statue." \n       \n           And, only a few days after the track\'s release, Kim\'s lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. \n       \n           One fan wrote ... "Finally someone stood up to Aimee." \n       \n           Another said Kim should\'ve apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . \n       \n           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim\'s fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul\'s fame.

"You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before." \n       \n           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in \'aIMee.\' \n       \n           There\'s no forgiving and forgetting here. \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward.

At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. \n       \n           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. \n       \n           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. \n       \n           Cudi  said , "Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. 🤦🏾\u200d♂️ just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big." \n       \n           Though Kid Cudi\'s set ended early, the crowd wasn\'t too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. \n       \n           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi\'s injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, "Pursuit of Happiness," to make up for his absence. \n       \n           KC couldn\'t say goodbye to his fans \xa0... some of whom seemed super confused. \n       \n           This was Kid Cudi\'s first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it\'s a bummer. \n       \n           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!! \n       \n           Originally Published -- 6:35 AM PT \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man.

Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n       \n           Originally Published -- 3:30 PM PT \n      '}

There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. \n       \n           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella\'s future. \n      '}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. \n       \n           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. \n       \n           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. \n       \n           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. \n       \n           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now.

Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution." \n       \n           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he\'s certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

Is this my fault?" \n       \n           She goes on, "The way I see it, I have two choices.

{'title': 'Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs', 'text': '\n           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we\'re told he hit the wrong one. \n       \n           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye\'s team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. \n       \n           Here\'s what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man.

He participated in the Pat\'s Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat\'s been all over his mind too. \n       \n           "I think about him a lot," Jake said, "and I know he\'s inspiring a lot of people to be better." \n       \n           We discussed Pat\'s legacy on a previous episode of  Last Days , available on all podcast platforms. \n      '}

Similarly, in 2022, the festival\'s 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. \n       \n           Still, from what we\'ve been told, this year\'s event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. \n       \n           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. \n       \n           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year\'s event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. \n       \n           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella\'s future. \n      '}

Cops Say Boob Popped Out', 'text': "\n           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. \n       \n           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. \n       \n           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting \xa0... and like we said, he served time. \n       \n           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. \n       \n           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. \n       \n           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day.

As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. \n       \n           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. \n       \n           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. \n       \n           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. \n       \n           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. \n       \n           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. \n       \n           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries. \n      "}

Cuts Off Funding", 'text': '\n           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in \'63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn\'t going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. \n       \n           "The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize," 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, "I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country." \n       \n           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia\'s NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution." \n       \n           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he\'s certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!', 'text': '\n           Kim Kardashian \'s social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. \n       \n           ICYMI ... Taylor\'s new song, "thanK you aIMee," is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a "bronze spray-tanned statue." \n       \n           And, only a few days after the track\'s release, Kim\'s lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. \n       \n           One fan wrote ... "Finally someone stood up to Aimee." \n       \n           Another said Kim should\'ve apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . \n       \n           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim\'s fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul\'s fame. Others have called on Kim\'s momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family\'s Hulu show. \n       \n           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim\'s radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. \n       \n           Taylor has made it no secret she\'s still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her \'TIME\' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. \n       \n           She said ... "You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before." \n       \n           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in \'aIMee.\' \n       \n           There\'s no forgiving and forgetting here. \n      '}

He participated in the Pat\'s Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat\'s been all over his mind too. \n       \n           "I think about him a lot," Jake said, "and I know he\'s inspiring a lot of people to be better." \n       \n           We discussed Pat\'s legacy on a previous episode of  Last Days , available on all podcast platforms. \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye\'s back in these rapper\'s good graces. \n       \n           Either way, it\'s a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake\'s history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! 👀 \n      '}

There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. \n       \n           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella\'s future. \n      '}

Clearly irritated with the onstage distraction, NM picks up the object and hurls it back into the crowd. \n       \n           Even after her high-velocity revenge ... Nicki appears to keep eyeing the rowdy concertgoer, but pressed on with the weekend set in Detroit. \n       \n           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. \n       \n           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. \n       \n           Still, there\'s been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. \n       \n           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom\'s ashes  onstage. \n       \n           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. \n       \n           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows. \n       \n           We\'re not sure why this trend is growing ... but celebs are def over it!!! \n      '}

Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to.

Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song.

She\'s not pretty, she can\'t act. Why is she so hot?" \n       \n           In a statement to Variety, Sweeney\'s rep  fired back  at Baum, blasting her for shamefully and unjustly belittling the actress to her students, while also questioning her character. Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as "Father of the Bride" and "Dead Ringers." \n       \n           Clearly, Sydney isn\'t bothered much by the whole ordeal as she lives it up in paradise. Her IG footage from her wonderful vacay just proves she\'s having the last laugh. \n      '}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been." \n       \n           Shakur says he won\'t be in the building for the fight, but he\'s eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he\'s very hopeful he\'ll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that\'ll pit them against each other in the near future. \n       \n           "I see myself fighting Devin.

Driver Saved by Brave Passersby!!!', 'text': "\n           A bunch of good Samaritans banded together to save a driver from a burning car at the very last second ... and the harrowing rescue is all on video. \n       \n           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. \n       \n           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. \n       \n           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. \n       \n           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. \n       \n           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. \n       \n           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. \n       \n           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries. \n      "}

Cuts Off Funding", 'text': '\n           Robert Kraft  graduated from Columbia in \'63, and has been a huge proponent of the school in every way, including financially ... but all that changed Monday when the billionaire Patriots owner made it clear he wasn\'t going to stand by and watch his University be taken over by hate and vitriol. \n       \n           "The school I love so much - the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity - is no longer an institution I recognize," 82-year-old Kraft said in a statement released by  Stand Up To Jewish Hate , adding, "I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country." \n       \n           Of course, since mid-last week, students and others have taken to Columbia\'s NYC campus to demand the University sever all ties to Israel. Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution." \n       \n           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he\'s certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

Swifties love him, but the Beyhive\'s pissed. \n       \n           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post\'s tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. \n       \n           After the release of "Fortnight" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, "It’s once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey \U0001f979 I love you so much. Thank you Tay 💕" \n       \n           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, "LEVII\'S JEANS" -- from the "Cowboy Carter" album -- his caption was a more simple, "i love you @beyonce." \n       \n           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyoncé, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! \n       \n           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, "Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god\'s sake." \n       \n           Another added ... "you are acting like as if he’s cursing on beyoncé or he said something bad like.. i don’t see any problem at all." \n       \n           Still, others felt Post\'s performance on Beyoncé\'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. \n       \n           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other\'s movie premieres  last year \xa0... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. \n       \n           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you\'re among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer. \n       \n           For more Taylor news, be sure to check out  "The TMZ Swift-Tea,"  available on all podcast platforms. \n      '}

Taylor\'s new song, "thanK you aIMee," is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title.

"Finally someone stood up to Aimee." \n       \n           Another said Kim should\'ve apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . \n       \n           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim\'s fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul\'s fame.

"R.I.P.

Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ...

Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it\'s enough to trigger the hefty fine. \n       \n           Lana\'s weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, "I LUV IT." \n       \n           However, we\'re told this is the only fine from the music festival\'s 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. \n       \n           The $28K is a huge difference from last year\'s curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival\'s 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. \n       \n           Still, from what we\'ve been told, this year\'s event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. \n       \n           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. \n       \n           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year\'s event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. \n       \n           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella\'s future. \n      '}

Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting \xa0... and like we said, he served time. \n       \n           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. \n       \n           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. \n       \n           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n       \n           Originally Published -- 3:30 PM PT \n      '}

You gotta fight me now n****! S***, right now, you need me n****!" \n       \n           The fight offer was followed by some trolling ... AB took a shot at Haney\'s father,  Bill , who he\'s had beef with for some time. \n       \n           "Hold on, anybody seen Bill? Where the f*** is Bill at?!" Broner said.

Bill?!" \n       \n           Broner wasn\'t the only boxer throwing shade at the Haneys ...

"And what about you d**k riding ass people." \n       \n           "I’m still coming to get n***** .. it’s not over! N***** gotta see me!" \n       \n           And, of course, Garcia -- who was a significant underdog after a bizarre fight camp -- also took shots, too ... saying Haney broke his jaw during the fight. \n       \n           Devin said that\'s fake news ... but,  that loss  on Saturday was all too real. Stay tuned for DH\'s next move. \n      '}

Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution." \n       \n           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he\'s certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a "bronze spray-tanned statue." \n       \n           And, only a few days after the track\'s release, Kim\'s lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. \n       \n           One fan wrote ... "Finally someone stood up to Aimee." \n       \n           Another said Kim should\'ve apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . \n       \n           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim\'s fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul\'s fame. Others have called on Kim\'s momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family\'s Hulu show. \n       \n           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim\'s radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. \n       \n           Taylor has made it no secret she\'s still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her \'TIME\' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. \n       \n           She said ... "You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before." \n       \n           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in \'aIMee.\' \n       \n           There\'s no forgiving and forgetting here. \n      '}

So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit.

As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward.

She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

I don\'t think it\'s an act." \n       \n           Of course, Shakur\'s referring to Ryan\'s  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. \n       \n           Despite those calls, the fight\'s not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. \n       \n           "I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn\'t go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand." \n       \n           SS continued ... "I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook." \n       \n           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it\'s highly unlikely, especially \'cause he isn\'t all that impressed with Ry on his best day. \n       \n           "I don\'t think that he\'s even on the elite level. I think that he\'s not really that good of a fighter." \n       \n           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. \n       \n           "I think Devin just goes in there and does what he\'s been doing. I think he\'s just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been." \n       \n           Shakur says he won\'t be in the building for the fight, but he\'s eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he\'s very hopeful he\'ll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that\'ll pit them against each other in the near future. \n       \n           "I see myself fighting Devin. I think that\'s the fight." \n       \n           It\'d be massive ... but first, Saturday night\'s super fight! 👊 \n      '}

Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it\'s enough to trigger the hefty fine. \n       \n           Lana\'s weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, "I LUV IT." \n       \n           However, we\'re told this is the only fine from the music festival\'s 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. \n       \n           The $28K is a huge difference from last year\'s curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival\'s 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. \n       \n           Still, from what we\'ve been told, this year\'s event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. \n       \n           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. \n       \n           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year\'s event.

She's still using crutches  BTW ... after breaking her foot in a gym accident. \n       \n           BTW ... all the Beckham kids made it out for their mom's bday -- with her boys  Brooklyn ,  Romeo  and  Cruz  pulling up as one big squad and husband  David Beckham  also attending. \n       \n           And, the A-List only begins with the Spice Girls and the Beckhams ... because some of the biggest stars on the planet also showed up for VB's big day. \n       \n           Tom Cruise  looked dapper in a tuxedo on the big night, and Gordon Ramsey arrived with wife Tana in tow. \n       \n           Among the other bold-faced names ...  Guy Ritchie ,  Jason Statham , Victoria's Secret Angel  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Marc Anthony  and his new wife  Nadia Ferreira ,  Eva Longoria,  and a whole lot more. \n       \n           It's a good sign the Beckhams are still throwing parties ... like we told you, investigative biographer,  Tom Bower 's promising a  tell-all book  full of stories about David's rumored affairs -- a glossed-over topic in their Netflix doc. \n       \n           Seems the Beckham clan isn't sweating the release though ... and, their longtime friends totally have their back. \n      "}

Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it\'s enough to trigger the hefty fine. \n       \n           Lana\'s weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, "I LUV IT." \n       \n           However, we\'re told this is the only fine from the music festival\'s 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. \n       \n           The $28K is a huge difference from last year\'s curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival\'s 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. \n       \n           Still, from what we\'ve been told, this year\'s event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. \n       \n           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. \n       \n           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year\'s event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. \n       \n           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella\'s future. \n      '}

I think when there’s a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well." \n       \n           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down. \n      '}

I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that’s how the last 14 breakups have been." \n       \n           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren\'t meant to be. \n       \n           While Ed shares his reasoning with the \'90 Day\' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fiancé\'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. \n       \n           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed\'s cold feet for the whole situation. \n       \n           Liz slams Ed as a "coward" and a "weakling" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, "I don\'t think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me." \n       \n           As for whether Liz and Ed\'s 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed\'s Instagram in recent months. \n       \n           Good luck to \'em both ... but we\'ll miss the drama. \n      '}

Cole\'s hit song "First Person Shooter," igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. \n       \n           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it\'s unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. \n       \n           But, assuming it\'s real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, "Y\'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can\'t even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times." \n       \n           Not really a line that\'s up for interpretation here ... Ye\'s taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn\'t miss. \n       \n           And, Ye\'s not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he\'s feeding into the frenzy. \n       \n           He\'s also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. \n       \n           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don\'t know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye\'s back in these rapper\'s good graces. \n       \n           Either way, it\'s a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake\'s history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! 👀 \n      '}

"He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!" \n       \n           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy\'s preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. \n       \n           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. \n       \n           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats.

Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble.

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ...

As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. \n       \n           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. \n       \n           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. \n       \n           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. \n       \n           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. \n       \n           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet. \n      "}

Shyne isn't quite going there. \n       \n           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. \n       \n           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. \n       \n           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. \n       \n           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. \n       \n           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting \xa0... and like we said, he served time. \n       \n           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. \n       \n           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. \n       \n           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. \n       \n           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. \n       \n           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. \n       \n           “Taylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,” Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. \n       \n           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music.

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n       \n           Originally Published -- 3:30 PM PT \n      '}

So far in their rap beef, he\'s repeatedly hit Chris with his history of domestic violence. \n       \n           Quavo\'s clearly triggered by  CB\'s last shot  -- "Weakest Link" -- where he said people wish Quavo died instead of Takeoff ... and now Quavo\'s responding to the bar by threatening to pull an actual trigger. \n       \n           Quavo raps, "This bullet got your name / Don\'t ever bring up Take p****." \n       \n           Takeoff hops in for the track\'s chorus, and the message is made very clear on what type of person they think CB is. What\'s not clear is if Takeoff\'s voice is patched together from his real recordings or if it\'s AI. \n       \n           Chris Brown has already responded to the track, saying he\'s not impressed and it sounds AI-generated. \n       \n           Musically, the ball\'s now back in CB\'s court ... let\'s see if he has more to say. \n      '}

He's Not Overrated To Me!!!", 'text': '\n           Some NBA hoopers think  Rudy Gobert   is the most overrated player in the league ... but his partner,  Julia Bonilla , says those guys are dead wrong -- passionately defending the Minnesota Timberwolves star on social media. \n       \n           The Athletic dropped the results of its  anonymous player survey  on Monday ... and as it turns out, 11 out of 81 of the participants claimed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year ain\'t all that. \n       \n           Bonilla -- who is expecting a child with Gobert -- got wind of the big man\'s new title ... and it\'s safe to say she\'s pissed, \'cause she fired back at the criticism with an Instagram post. \n       \n           "My partner is the most dedicated, focused, hard-working person I have ever met," Bonilla said. "He hasn\'t stolen anything from anyone and deserves all the respect for his determination and commitment to his career." \n       \n           "It\'s hard for me to stay quiet in front of so much stupidity, disrespect and nonsense," she added. "I am so proud of the person he is -- fair, a great teammate, with a good heart and a strong mind." \n       \n           Of course, the Wolves are in the middle of a first-round playoff matchup with the Phoenix Suns ... and Bonilla said she\'s pulling for her man\'s team throughout the run. \n       \n           "I am proud of you, and our son is proud of you." \n       \n           As we previously reported, Gobert and Bonilla  went public  with the pregnancy back in February ... and a few weeks later, he told  TMZ Sports  it was a "blessing" to start a family. \n       \n           Something Bonilla will certainly like -- Gobert was just named a finalist for the NBA\'s DPOY once again this season ... and that award actually means something. \n      '}

But His Daughter Says Chill", 'text': "\n           Chris Pratt  and  Katherine Schwarzenegger  have architecture super fans (yeah, they're a thing) up in arms after they demolished an historic L.A. pad to build their dream home, but the architect's daughter says it's not that big of a loss. \n       \n           Erin Ellwood , daughter of the legendary architect  Craig Ellwood  -- who designed and built the Brentwood, CA home in 1950 -- tells TMZ there's no need for the uproar over the Pratts' teardown of the iconic residence known as the Zimmerman home. \n       \n           In her eyes, it's not nearly the tragedy her father's fans are making it out to be, especially because it's not the most spectacular example of his elegant work. \n       \n           Erin says she definitely would've preferred someone to simply renovate the place and keep it standing -- but still, she's not bent out of shape about Katherine and Chris' decision to start afresh on the property. \n       \n           The Hollywood couple purchased the property last year for $12.5 million due to its location ... and Erin says she respects their desire to build a family nest close to the double compound owned by Katherine's mom  Maria Shriver . \n       \n           All that being said, Erin's laying down the eco-friendly law, saying what she's really not a fan of is waste. \n       \n           She's all about giving back, suggesting it would be nice if things from the old pad got recycled to help those in need, or at least, given new life in architecture schools. \n       \n           It remains to be seen whether Erin's stance will be the chill pill architecture fans need to ease their fury over C&K tearing down the historic gem. \n       \n           Despite the hate, the couple is marching forward, swapping a piece of L.A. history to reportedly construct a bigger, bolder, modern farmhouse-style pad which is right on trend. \n       \n           As they say, out with the old, in with the new -- even for an Ellwood classic. \n      "}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ...

As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n       \n           Originally Published -- 3:30 PM PT \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up.

Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

"He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!" \n       \n           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy\'s preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. \n       \n           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. \n       \n           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. \n       \n           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! 👀 \n      '}

GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. \n       \n           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. \n       \n           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these.

GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. \n       \n           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now.

Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. \n       \n           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. \n       \n           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. \n       \n           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting \xa0... and like we said, he served time. \n       \n           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. \n       \n           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. \n       \n           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses.

She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken. It is my hope that Columbia and its leadership will stand up to this hate by ending these protests immediately and will work to earn back the respect and trust of the many of us who have lost faith in the institution." \n       \n           While Robert is far from the only alumnus speaking out, he\'s certainly one of the most influential. In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

Cole . \n       \n           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled "Like That (Remix)" -- on an episode of "The Download" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. \n       \n           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  "Like That"  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole\'s hit song "First Person Shooter," igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. \n       \n           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it\'s unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. \n       \n           But, assuming it\'s real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, "Y\'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can\'t even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times." \n       \n           Not really a line that\'s up for interpretation here ... Ye\'s taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn\'t miss. \n       \n           And, Ye\'s not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he\'s feeding into the frenzy. \n       \n           He\'s also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. \n       \n           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don\'t know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye\'s back in these rapper\'s good graces. \n       \n           Either way, it\'s a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake\'s history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! 👀 \n      '}

Now, will that be enough to silence the hate? Of course not. \n      '}

TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n       \n           Originally Published -- 3:30 PM PT \n      '}

Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to.

Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges.

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. \n       \n           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength.

Some protestors have been seen showing support for Hamas and their actions on October 7, even calling for repeated attacks. \n       \n           The situation has gotten so tense on campus, classes have been switched from in-person to virtual. \n       \n           Kraft believes the school has lost a handle on the situation, and cannot adequately protect their students. \n       \n           "I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken.

In fact, the Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, an on-campus hub for Jewish students, bears his name. \n       \n           Over the weekend, The White House issued a statement admonishing those at Columbia who aren\'t peacefully protesting, and rather threatening to harm Jewish students. \n       \n           "While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous." \n      '}

Arrest me." \n       \n           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn\'t really land well with her audience. \n       \n           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. \n       \n           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn\'t have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. \n       \n           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job. \n      '}

We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne\'s, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We\'re told they frequent the Chateau. \n       \n           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

Cole\'s hit song "First Person Shooter," igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. \n       \n           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it\'s unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. \n       \n           But, assuming it\'s real ...

Ye\'s taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn\'t miss. \n       \n           And, Ye\'s not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J.

Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye\'s back in these rapper\'s good graces. \n       \n           Either way, it\'s a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake\'s history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! 👀 \n      '}

She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses.

She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

I don\'t think that he\'s really taking the fight serious," Stevenson said. \n       \n           "It seems like he\'s more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he\'s coming 100% ready for the fight. I don\'t think it\'s an act." \n       \n           Of course, Shakur\'s referring to Ryan\'s  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. \n       \n           Despite those calls, the fight\'s not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. \n       \n           "I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn\'t go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand." \n       \n           SS continued ... "I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook." \n       \n           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it\'s highly unlikely, especially \'cause he isn\'t all that impressed with Ry on his best day. \n       \n           "I don\'t think that he\'s even on the elite level. I think that he\'s not really that good of a fighter." \n       \n           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. \n       \n           "I think Devin just goes in there and does what he\'s been doing. I think he\'s just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been." \n       \n           Shakur says he won\'t be in the building for the fight, but he\'s eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he\'s very hopeful he\'ll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that\'ll pit them against each other in the near future. \n       \n           "I see myself fighting Devin. I think that\'s the fight." \n       \n           It\'d be massive ... but first, Saturday night\'s super fight! 👊 \n      '}

Cops Say Boob Popped Out', 'text': "\n           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. \n       \n           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. \n       \n           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

His backers are speaking similar code. \n      '}

Claims Self-Defense!!!', 'text': '\n           4:37 PM PT --  Bam Margera  just posted video to Instagram showing a portion of the attempts he says he made to call 911 for police assistance last week ... recorded before he ended up taking matters into his own hands, fighting off a threatening stranger. \n       \n           Bam\'s obviously frustrated at the lack of response in the video, and claims when no cops showed up, the whole neighborhood told him to go handle it ... and clapped when he was done. \n       \n           Bam Margera recently found himself throwing down with a stranger -- a fist fight captured on camera, but Bam says he was simply protecting himself and friends ... TMZ has learned. \n       \n           ICYMI ... the video shows the \'Jackass\' star wailing on an unidentified man. The clip\'s making the rounds online and has many of Bam\'s fans speculating the face-off has something to do with a tattoo dispute Bam posted about Monday -- he\'s calling his latest ink job "highway robbery" -- but we\'re told this is an entirely separate incident. \n       \n           Bam\'s manager  Mike Quinn  tells TMZ … the fight in question happened last week in L.A. -- and was sparked when the stranger threatened to kill Bam and his entourage outside of the property where Bam was staying. \n       \n           Mike adds, "This individual, who had been pacing nearby for hours relentlessly, and causing disturbances by yelling and overturning trash cans, escalated the confrontation by punching Margera when he stepped outside to smoke." \n       \n           We\'re told repeated calls to the police were made, but no assistance arrived. Mike says someone from Bam\'s camp began recording the incident in response to the aggressive harassment. \n       \n           Bam tells us ... "I\'m not going to be threatened or attacked without defending myself and my friends or people trying to just walk by this idiot, I aimed only to neutralize the threat and ensure the safety of my crew." \n       \n           His rep tells TMZ the altercation ended swiftly with no injuries, and the aggressor eventually departed without returning. \n       \n           This update comes a month after Bam was  caught on camera  getting into a heated argument with girlfriend  Dannii Marie , who was concerned about his sobriety at the time. \n       \n           Never a dull moment in the life of Bam. \n       \n           Originally Published -- 3:30 PM PT \n      '}

I think when there’s a good law enforcement and public safety presence, people can relax and when they can relax things tend to go well." \n       \n           It seems the major needs to take a peek on social media for a clearer account of what went down. \n      '}

Famous Restaurateurs', 'text': '\n           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we\'re told he hit the wrong one. \n       \n           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye\'s team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. \n       \n           Here\'s what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We\'re told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. \n       \n           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we\'re told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. \n       \n           At this point, we\'re told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here\'s the crazy part -- we\'re told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he\'s a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. \n       \n           As for who these twins are ... we\'re told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don\'t know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you\'re unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. \n       \n           Some of the venues under their belt ...

As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. \n       \n           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we\'re told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). \n       \n           We\'re also told this ... so far, cops haven\'t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye\'s account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We\'re told the case is still under investigation. \n       \n           As for where things go from here, we\'re told once this investigation is wrapped -- it\'ll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it\'s unclear if anything will come of it. \n       \n           We\'ve reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. \n       \n           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, "This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile." \n      '}

We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures." \n       \n           Broward County State\'s Attorney\'s Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. \n       \n           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them. \n       \n           His new single, "Stressed Out," is probably a fitting description of his mood prior to getting the good news. \n      '}

Shyne isn't quite going there. \n       \n           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. \n       \n           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. \n       \n           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. \n       \n           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. \n       \n           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. \n       \n           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. \n       \n           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges.

They even performed together last year in Europe. \n       \n           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. \n       \n           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime. \n      "}

Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. \n       \n           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. \n       \n           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. \n       \n           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. \n       \n           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. \n       \n           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. \n       \n           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. \n       \n           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back. \n      "}

TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. \n       \n           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. \n       \n           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would "jokingly" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. \n       \n           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. \n       \n           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. \n       \n           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. \n       \n           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. \n       \n           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus "is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz." \n       \n           "Mr. Ruiz did assault her," Kalemkiarian added, "did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship." \n       \n           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. \n       \n           The judge gave sole custody of the couple\'s two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. \n       \n           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027. \n      '}

Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. \n       \n           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi\'s injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, "Pursuit of Happiness," to make up for his absence. \n       \n           KC couldn\'t say goodbye to his fans \xa0... some of whom seemed super confused. \n       \n           This was Kid Cudi\'s first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it\'s a bummer. \n       \n           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!! \n       \n           Originally Published -- 6:35 AM PT \n      '}

{'title': "Dwyane Wade 'High Dining' For Best Buds ... Gabrielle Makes Magic!!!", 'text': '\n           Dwyane Wade \'s annual "High Dining" dinner, in honor of 420, went down with several of the NBA great\'s famous pals rolling up to join the festivities -- including a few surprises. \n       \n           TMZ got vid of D. Wade and the founders of Jeeter -- the cannabis co. behind the event -- connecting Saturday night. Dwyane is a board member for the brand, so they\'ve made a habit of blowing out 420 every year with a celeb-packed evening. \n       \n           Organizers connected to the event tell us the high-grade guest list included  Zachary Levi ,  Jay Ellis ,   Jeff Ross ,   Seth Green ,   Karrueche Tran ,  Nazanin Mandi ,  Jozzy ,  Armani White  and  Freddie Prinze Jr.  ... who all partook in the 3-course meal along with other festivities. \n       \n           His wife  Gabrielle Union  stood in as magician  Kevin Li \'s assistant -- thankfully everyone kept their hands to themselves, and no one was sliced and diced on the table. 👀 \n       \n           The event also debuted Jeeter and the  Bob Marley  estate\'s master collaboration -- a 4.2-gram pre-roll packaged in a guitar case ... in other words, a Jah-endorsed rollout! \n       \n           Bob\'s grandson, Grammy-nominated singer  Skip Marley  also performed "Jamming" and "One Love" -- and the significance of having the latest generation of Marley hitmakers present needed no explanation. \n       \n           Neither did D. Wade\'s self-review of the event!!! \n      '}

Jeeter recruited Bussa Bus to perform at the after-party of their 420 "High Dining" event ... and while he was trying to do his duty, he wasn\'t getting high vibes from the crowd. \n       \n           Basically, the audience wasn\'t giving Busta the energy he felt his classic tune "Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See" deserved -- so, he cut the music and told the onlookers to get their minds right. \n       \n           Busta says he, along with  Spliff Star  and  DJ Scratchator , have been ripping mics since childhood, and he\'ll be damned if anyone doesn\'t respect his hip hop hierarchy!!! \n       \n           The audience woke up for take 2, and Busta wooed the fans before getting a surprise of his own -- Team Jeeter crafted a new cannabis strain in Busta\'s honor, adding him to the family alongside D. Wade. \n       \n           The Dungeon Dragon already spits fire ... now he has the smoke to match!!! \n      '}

Monkey See, Monkey Ride", 'text': '\n           As if L.A.\'s famed Venice Beach scene wasn\'t wild enough -- now it\'s got apes patrollin\' the sand ... on horseback, no less!!! \n       \n           Yeah, the marketing team behind "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes" came up with a seriously eye-catching way to hype the flick Monday ... getting a bunch of apes to saddle up and ride around the beach. \n       \n           No, they\'re not real apes -- PETA would be all over that -- but the actors in costume were pretty convincing at a glance ... looking very much like a scene ripped straight from the movie\'s plot of the apes taking over. \n       \n           Luckily, the actors didn\'t exactly put the horses into a full gallop, opting for a slower stroll around the beach ... paired with intense, menacing stares to make their presence felt. \n       \n           Despite the lack of action, the ape invasion certainly got tongues wagging about the upcoming flick, which is set to swing into U.S. cinemas May 10. \n       \n           The online fandom went bananas over the marketing stunt, hailing it as pure genius and confessing it\'s got them hooked and ready to watch the movie. \n       \n           Directed by  Wes Ball , this movie serves as the sequel to 2017\'s "War for the Planet of the Apes." \n       \n           The only issue with this stunt is Venice Beach is already filled with outrageous sights and characters -- so, primates on patrol might seem like just another Monday. \n      '}
