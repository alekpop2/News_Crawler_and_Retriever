Brittany Mahomes Bikini Holds On For Dear Life ... On Yacht W/ Gal Pals,"
           Patrick Mahomes ' wife,  Brittany , really is a bikini model now -- the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit rookie put her stunning body on display during her vacation in Mexico ... and flaunted some serious underboob in the process. 
       
           The Kansas City Chiefs superstar and his longtime partner had a romantic trip in Cabo San Lucas over the past several days ... but on Sunday, it was all about the girls. 
       
           Brittany was spotted on a luxurious yacht with at least four other ladies ... soaking up the sun as they lounged on the back deck. 
       
           Britt rocked a tiny, orange two-piece for the occasion ... which is something she's quite accustomed to lately, as she was named to  SI's newest swimsuit issue  back in February. 
       
           No word on what all the ladies got into ... but chances are they had  Taylor Swift 's new 'Tortured Poets Department' album blaring on the speakers, considering Brittany was  super pumped  for  Travis Kelce 's girlfriend when the project dropped. 
       
           It was quite the eventful trip for the Mahomeses -- as we previously reported, the couple was  heckled by Raiders fans  while out at dinner together last week. 
       
           But all good things come to an end ... and same goes for the trip -- after all, the next football season will be here before ya know it.

Post Malone Tribute to Taylor Swift Sparks Bad Blood with Beyonc√© Fans,"
           Post Malone  has gotta be screaming, ""damned if ya do, damned if ya don't"" -- after recording collabs with  Taylor Swift  AND  Beyonc√©  ... Swifties love him, but the Beyhive's pissed. 
       
           The drama started when one fan called out the striking difference between Post's tributes for Taylor and Bey ... pointing out he wrote a heartfelt note to TS, but just dropped a simple shout-out for B. 
       
           After the release of ""Fortnight"" -- the song he did with Taylor -- Post took to Instagram and shared a photo of them in the studio, and wrote, ""It‚Äôs once in a lifetime that someone like @taylorswift comes into this world. I am floored by your heart and your mind, and I am beyond honored to have been asked to help you with your journey ü•π I love you so much. Thank you Tay üíï"" 
       
           While he also uploaded a tribute for his Bey duet, ""LEVII'S JEANS"" -- from the ""Cowboy Carter"" album -- his caption was a more simple, ""i love you @beyonce."" 
       
           Several fans on X took it as a snub to Beyonc√©, but not all agreed and the debate was on -- Beyhive v. Swiftees! 
       
           One team Taylor rebuttal explained, ""Taylor wrote two posts about him. he gave her same energy. stop crying for god's sake."" 
       
           Another added ... ""you are acting like as if he‚Äôs cursing on beyonc√© or he said something bad like.. i don‚Äôt see any problem at all."" 
       
           Still, others felt Post's performance on Beyonc√©'s album was more impressive ... and deserved more than a one-sentence declaration of love. 
       
           At the end of the day, Bey and Tay are very vocal about supporting each other. Remember, they  attended each other's movie premieres  last year ¬†... shutting down any notion of a rivalry. 
       
           So, the drama all seems unnecessary -- unless, of course, you're among the overly faithful fanbase of either singer.

Dutch Soccer Final Fire Breaks Out Behind Goal ... Game Delayed 30 Minutes,"
           A soccer final in the Netherlands was a real barn burner ... quite literally 'cause a fire broke out behind one of the goals throwing the match into chaos. 
       
           Feyenoord played NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch Cup Final Sunday -- the championship match of a major knockout tournament in the Netherlands -- when fans reportedly set off fireworks in the stadium ... and a huge banner caught fire. 
       
           The plume of black smoke's totally encasing the fans here ... making it difficult even to see the ones in the middle while those on the sides seem to be waving for help. 
       
           The fire -- reported to be relatively small -- was apparently put out quickly by firefighters, and there are no reported injuries ... but, check out the pic. Definitely, could've been worse. 
       
           BTW ... sports conspiracy theorists can have a field day with this one -- 'cause it was a Feyenoord banner that caught fire causing players to evacuate the field for about half an hour in the 55th minute. 
       
           Unclear if their supporters actually started the fire -- though some online are claiming they did -- but, four minutes after play resumed Feyenoord scored the lone goal of the afternoon winning the match 1-0. Coincidence??? 
       
           In any case, it's Feyenoord's 14th KNVB Dutch Cup victory ... and, ya gotta think their fans are pretty fired up about it!!!

Taylor Swift Intense Exercise Routine Would Make Others Barf,"
           Taylor Swift 's workout routine is so brutal that it would make some people throw up while forcing others to lay down on the floor ... so says the pop superstar's trainer  Kirk Myers . 
       
           Myers revealed to Vogue the singer's killer exercise regimen as he finally embraced his cool title as ""Taylor Swift's trainer"" after a decade of working with her. 
       
           Myers provided a road map on how Taylor prepped for her global ""Eras"" tour, requiring her to perform for 3 hours and 15 minutes each show. 
       
           He says they choreographed her workout like a professional athlete with an ""off-season"" when she wasn't touring and an ""in-season"" when she was performing. 
       
           Off-season training was rough ... Taylor trained up to 6 days a week for about two hours each day. She zeroed in on improving her strength and conditioning while also focusing on core exercises for balance and stability, which would help her dance and maneuver onstage. 
       
           While she was on the road, Taylor dove into in-season training to maintain her stability, mobility and strength. She would do biomechanical stretches to strengthen her spine, soft tissues and other joints in her body. 
       
           Myers says Taylor was so committed to her exercise routine she would perform 4 concerts in a row with super intensity and still show up to the gym. 
       
           ‚ÄúTaylor is the most resilient person I have ever met,‚Äù Myers told Vogue, adding that she always persevered with each difficult challenge before moving on to the next exercise. 
       
           As a side note, the two first met through a mutual friend and, yes, Myers admitted he was already a big fan of Taylor and her music. Just another Swiftie!

The Spice Girls Impromptu Performance Caught On Tape By David Beckham,"
           The Spice Girls had their own mini-reunion performance at  Victoria Beckham 's 50th bday bash Saturday night ... and hubby  David  made sure to capture it all on camera!

David Beckham Sues Mark Wahlberg's Co. ... You're Unfit to Make Fitness Deals!!!,"
           Two fitness titans are on a path to square off in court, because  David Beckham  has sued  Mark Wahlberg 's company over a fitness deal that made the former soccer star way lighter in the wallet. 
       
           Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer. 
       
           Beckham, who got close to Mark when he moved to Cali to play for the L.A. Galaxy, became F45's Global Ambassador. The selling point -- David has millions of social media followers, so it would presumably greatly expand the reach of the company. 
       
           Well, things didn't work out. Beckham says he never got the $10 mil he was promised ... this after the company's stock tanked. BTW ... those posts have been deleted. 
       
           F45 asked the judge to 86 the lawsuit, calling it ""fraudulent,"" but the judge said the case will move on. 
       
           BTW ... David's not alone.  Terrell Owens  filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000.

Arnold Schwarzenegger Here's How I Punked Sly Into Starring in Movie Flop!!!,"
           Arnold Schwarzenegger  epically punked  Sylvester Stallone  into signing on for the most disastrous film of Sly's career, and that's exactly what Arnold wanted to happen! 
       
           Arnold and Sly sat down with  Harvey  for a candid, sometimes stunning convo about the intense rivalry between the 2 mega-action stars. 
       
           Sly was stunned as Arnold explained how he got his now-good friend to star in ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot."" Arnold knew the script was terrible, but he had heard Sly was kinda interested in it. So Arnold figured if Sly felt he wanted the role, Sly would jump at it. 
       
           So Arnold called his agent, who in turn called Sly's agent to say A.S. was super interested in the script. Arnold then secretly called the director to express interest -- something Sly didn't know until now. 
       
           Well, short story kinda long, Sly jumped and took the role, and the movie was a disaster, which is exactly what Arnold wanted. And Sly isn't shy about saying he got played.

'TMZ Presents Arnold & Sly' Torn Pec Forced 'Rocky II' Change ... Sly Brings the Pain!!!,"
           Sylvester Stallone  came within a hair's breadth of tanking ""Rocky II"" because of a gruesome injury, and you won't believe how he powered through to shoot the flick! 
       
           Sly and  Arnold Schwarzenegger  sat down with  Harvey , and for the first time ever together they talked about their unbelievable rivalry and how it blossomed into a close friendship. 
       
           Arnold's trainer and compadre, bodybuilding legend  Franco Columbu , trained Sly for ""Rocky II,"" and when Franco challenged Sly to a bench press competition, the actor was game ... until he ripped his pec off the bone. 
       
           Here's the problem. The injury occurred a month-and-a-half before Sly was set to star in and direct the 'Rocky' sequel -- so, you gotta see him explain how he pulled it outta the fire! 
       
           As 'Rocky' fans know, Balboa's normally a southpaw (lefthanded), but in ""Rocky II"" he learns to fight righthanded. That wasn't just a random plot twist -- turns out it was the only way Sly could film with his injury. 
       
           As Sly put it to us ... pushing through the pain is just what driven folks like Arnold and himself did to make it to the top.

GloRilla Dame's Estranged Wife Can't Clown Me ... Custom GloLillard Jersey,"
           GloRilla 's not letting  Damian Lillard 's estranged wife get her down ... turning a roast on its head by embracing a new nickname she gave her. 
       
           The rapper posted a video to her IG story showing off her fresh new jersey ... a yellow crop top-esque fit with red lettering on the back reading ""GloLillard"" with Dame's number ""0"" below it. 
       
           It's a pretty friendly shot clap back at Lillard's estranged wife  Kay'La  who the Milwaukee Bucks star  filed for divorce  from back in October. 
       
           Remember ... after GloRilla's recent arrest for DUI, Kay'La  posted Glo's mug shot  on IG -- jokingly calling her a sister wife and throwing out ""#FreeGloLillard."" 
       
           Lots of fans took it as a shot a GloRilla ... who's made  pretty clear advances  toward Lillard recently -- and many wanted to see how Glo would respond. 
       
           Seems like it's not bothering Glo all that much though ... instead, she;'s embracing the nickname -- and, maybe she's hoping to manifest a new coupling with her clothes. 
       
           Besides, Glo's got her own issues ... we broke the story, cops  arrested and booked  her last week on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge -- so, she's probably not trying to start any more drama. 
       
           Anyhoo ... seems like GloLillard's here to stay -- whether his soon-to-be ex likes it or not.

David Zucker Not Involved In 'Naked Gun' Remake ... No One's Reached Out!!!,"
           David Zucker 's not excited about ""The Naked Gun"" remake ... saying he's not involved with the project, and he's worried the team behind it doesn't realize how difficult the spoof is. 
       
           We spoke with Zucker -- director of famous classic comedies like 'Naked Gun' and ""Airplane!"" -- about the Paramount+ remake starring  Liam Neeson  and  Pamela Anderson  ... and, he says he doesn't know how it's going to turn out 'cause no one's reaching out to him. 
       
           Zucker says he and his partners,  Pat Proft  and  Mike McManus  submitted a script to Paramount back in 2018 ... and says they thought the studio liked the concept. 
       
           So, he says it came as a bit of a shock when they handed the franchise to a totally different set of creatives ... who he says haven't even reached out for advice or a possible cameo. 
       
           As for how they'll handle the material ... DZ says this type of spoof isn't rocket science, but it sure ain't easy -- adding he often says, ""Don't try this at home"" when it comes to this style. 
       
           And, David says he's not convinced a remake's necessary -- 'cause younger generations are already finding movies like 'Naked Gun,' ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"" and more on their own. 
       
           BTW ... watch the clip til the end to hear Zucker's thoughts on  O.J. Simpson 's acting in 'Naked Gun' -- and, you can see the comedy legend's still got it! 
       
           News of the 'Naked Gun' remake broke this week ... with Neeson and Anderson attached to star and Lonely Island/'SNL' alum  Akiva Schaffer  to co-write and direct. 
       
           In any case, Zucker's skeptical about the project ... unsure if it'll hit its target, or end up misfiring completely.

Ryan Garcia Beats The Crap Out Of Devin Haney ... Yet Still Not Champ,"
           Ryan Garcia  scored a major upset over boxing champion  Devin Haney , knocking him on his ass THREE TIMES during the dramatic bout. 
       
           Garcia stood toe-to-toe with Haney -- the WBC junior lightweight title holder -- Saturday night at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center. The two went the distance, pulverizing each other for 12 grueling rounds. 
       
           In the end, Garcia snagged the majority decision, and, deservedly so, after he repeatedly dropped Haney to the canvas with powerful blows. 
       
           Check out this video showing all the knockdowns ... The first occurred in the 7th round when Garcia hit Haney in the head with a left hook. 
       
           Then came another left hook from Garcia in the 10th round, leveling Haney. And finally, in the 11th round, Garcia did it again with yet another left hook! 
       
           Clearly, Haney didn't get the memo about Garcia's lethal left punch. 
       
           But, Haney retained his title because Garcia failed to make weight before the fight, disqualifying him from winning the belt, yet the boxing event still went forward.

           The dramatic moment took place right before the checkered flag was waved ... when  Michael McDowell  -- who led 36 laps of the race -- triggered the chaos after attempting to block  Brad Keselowski . 
       
           The two traded places multiple times, but McDowell's last effort made contact with Keselowski ... and that's when Michael's Ford Mustang turned sideways and caused the massive wreck. 
       
           A bunch of drivers lost control on the racetrack, crashing into each other, including one car that went airborne onto the wall. Thankfully, none of the drivers reported any serious injuries. 
       
           Many ended the race shaking their heads, but the 23XI driver was clearly thrilled with the result ... 'cause he was able to dodge the pileup and get his first win at Talladega. 
       
           Michael Jordan  was proud of his driver's crazy win ... and celebrated with his family, including Reddick's son.

           Plummer and Tillman were good pals before the Army ranger's tragic death in 2004 -- the two played together at Arizona State and then once more with the Arizona Cardinals -- and when we asked if it was time to include the former defensive back in Canton, Plummer said he'd be for it. 
       
           After all, despite playing in just 60 games in his pro career, there might not be a more universally respected person in the history of the NFL. 
       
           ""If it was about impact,"" the ex-Cards quarterback said, ""then, hell yeah, he should be in there."" 
       
           But, Plummer said he's not going to sweat it if Tillman never gets a bust someday... telling us he's not even sure if Pat would've wanted the honor -- because he was just that humble. 
       
           Plus, Plummer can take solace in knowing Pat's already kind of in there -- explaining to us someone snuck a Tillman card into a mural that's already up in the museum. 
       
           Monday, if you weren't aware, marks the 20th anniversary since Tillman was killed while serving his country ... and Plummer has already spent a ton of time this month remembering his good friend. He participated in the Pat's Run race in Tempe with some 30,000 others on April 13 -- and, in between, he tells us Pat's been all over his mind too.

Mike Jenkins Ex-Dallas Cowboys Star Involved In Heated Confrontation At Florida Bar,"
           Former Dallas Cowboys star  Mike Jenkins  was involved in a heated confrontation at a Florida bar over the weekend ... video obtained by  TMZ Sports  shows. 
       
           The incident happened at The Kenwood on Sunday night in St. Petersburg ... after Jenkins had apparently become upset with the way one of the establishment's employees had handled his credit card. 
       
           A witness tells us the worker had either misplaced or lost Jenkins' plastic -- which agitated the former 2008 NFL Draft first-round pick. 
       
           According to the witness, after making a scene inside the bar, Jenkins -- a University of South Florida alum -- then went outside and screamed at a security guard at the door. 
       
           In footage from the scene, you can hear the ex-defensive back drop cuss words left and right -- while insisting he did nothing wrong. Then, at one point, you can hear him yell, ""Give me my motherf***ing card!"" 
       
           A rep for the St. Petersburg Police Dept. tells us cops were dispatched to the bar at around 1:39 AM on Monday morning due to ""a fight or disturbance."" However, the spokesperson said no arrests were made. The rep added that Jenkins was issued a trespass warning -- and nothing more. 
       
           We've made multiple attempts to reach out to Jenkins for comment, but so far, we haven't heard anything back yet. 
       
           39-year-old Jenkins played in 71 games in his five seasons in Dallas -- and made one Pro Bowl in 2009. Following his time in Big D, he logged snaps with the Raiders and Buccaneers. 
       
           In 2016, Jenkins tried to latch on with the Cardinals, but he got injured in the preseason ... and never played another down in the NFL again.

           That said, Ne-Yo says he's not going to Washington, D.C. to fight for a law change ... 'cause it's not currently affecting his personal life, and he's not sure he wants to marry multiple women. 
       
           We also asked Ne-Yo why he doesn't write songs about dating multiple women ... and, he says it's 'cause he draws on his own life experiences, and this is his first relationship with two women. 
       
           And, we even asked Ne-Yo's GFs if they're interested in walking down the aisle together to marry the star ... and, ya gotta see their reactions to the question.

Kanye & Bianca Out For An Afternoon Drive ... Battery Report No Big Deal,"
           Kanye West  and  Bianca Censori  seemed to be in good spirits this week ... driving around L.A. in separate cars -- this just hours after a man filed a battery report against Ye. 
       
           Photogs snapped the couple caught in rush hour traffic Wednesday -- and they were rolling in completely different vehicles. BC was piloting her Porsche and Ye was riding shotgun in a Cybertruck ... both seemingly happy and healthy after what sounds like a tough night. 
       
           Hard to tell what Bianca's wearing here -- unclear if it's her  usual level of sheer  or not -- but, she's got her eyes firmly fixed on the road while waiting at traffic lights in her sweet ride. 
       
           Ye, meanwhile, was looking at his phone and chatting up the other two dudes in his own whip. The trio seems totally unbothered by Kanye's potential legal issues -- which may or may not amount to anything as LAPD delves into their investigation. 
       
           We broke the story ...  cops are investigating Ye  after he allegedly hit a guy who his team claims sexually assaulted Bianca. Law enforcement sources tell us Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation, and the guy claiming Ye hit him didn't need medical attention. Ye's team says the man in question had assaulted Bianca. 
       
           It's interesting Ye and Bianca are already back out in public so soon after something like that ... and yet they are. From the looks of it, the whole saga is the furthest thing from their mind. 
       
           Remember, this isn't the first time Ye's been in the crosshairs of the legal system -- he's been  accused of getting handsy  with people in public in the past ... but he's never been criminally charged over the past episodes. 
       
           In any case, seems like the couple's doing just fine ... just keep on rolling, we suppose.

           Of course, Pete was permanently banned by MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on baseball while manager of the Reds. Rose denied the claim for more than a decade, before finally admitting in 2004 that he had placed wagers. 
       
           The all-time hit leader doesn't believe Ohtani is innocent -- federal investigators have said he's a victim -- but Rose doesn't buy it. 
       
           Major League Baseball has pressed pause on their investigation, opting to wait until Mizuhara's criminal case is closed, to determine if they'll investigate Ohtani, or anyone else involved, any further. 
       
           But, you know where Pete stands.

"Tour√© Drake Started Battle, Kendrick Will Win War ... Gonna Be Tragic!!!","
           Drake  will be licking his wounds and bowing to King  Kendrick Lamar  ... a shameful sight  Tour√©  says will become Drake's reality after their rap battle is all said and done. 
       
           The tenured music and cultural critic hopped on ""TMZ Live"" on Thursday and pinpointed what he feels are dings in Drake's armor ... mainly his comeback response, which Tour√© isn't all that impressed with. 
       
           Drake has been owning up to his ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" track ... using the lyrics to tease both  Metro Boomin  and Kendrick's manager on social media ... but Tour√© feels sneaky tactics pale in comparison to the points K. Dot has already put on the board. 
       
           Remember, Kendrick's feature on  Future  and Metro's  ""Like That"" record  has been No. 1 on the Hot 100 for 3 straight weeks now and Tour√© is daring any DJ to try and drop ""Push Ups"" in the club ... he says the song will bomb!!! 
       
           Tour√© says Kendrick and everyone else is well within their rights to fire back at Drake after years of sneak disses ... and he's strongly against giving Drake a handicap for not showing signs of obliteration. 
       
           It's an interesting viewpoint ... especially since Drake claimed it was Kendrick who gets the benefit of the doubt over him. 
       
           At any rate, Tour√©'s convinced a Kendrick nuke is coming. His backers are speaking similar code.

Ne-Yo Gets Warning from Carl Thomas ... Throuple Not All It's Cracked Up to Be!!!,"
           Ne-Yo  is happily living his truth as a non-monogamous man -- but his R&B OG  Carl Thomas  is forewarning him that 2 heads aren't always better than one!!! 
       
           The ""Because Of You"" singer was turning heads in L.A. yesterday when TMZ Hip Hop caught him at The Grove with both of his girlfriends -- and, though he told us he's not looking to get hitched anytime soon, he IS  loving the lifestyle !!! 
       
           Carl's a little older than Ne-Yo but added his own 2 cents to the convo after The Shade Room reposted our clip -- he says he once entertained a throuple situation but says time and wisdom changed his ways. 
       
           The singer was once a platinum-selling powerhouse on  Diddy 's Bad Boy Records in the early 2000s, when you gotta imagine he had plenty of options in the female department. But, now he's testifying to being a one-woman man, and seems to believe Ne-Yo will eventually narrow down his options too. 
       
           Ne-Yo's fresh off  a divorce , and told us everyone's situation varies.

"Drake My Diss Is Streaming ... Now What, Chumps?!?","
           Drake  officially owned up to his ""Push Ups"" diss track against  Kendrick Lamar ,  Metro Boomin , etc. ... the song is now available on streaming services --  DJ Whoo Kid  tag, copyright stamps and all!!! 
       
           As of Friday, the move puts to bed speculation that the song  was a product of AI , or that Drake was scared to claim it on the charts. 
       
           We just had  Tour√©  on ""TMZ Live"" ... and he doesn't think Drake's diss  has the quality to move units  or butts on the dance floor. 
       
           The upcoming week will be the ultimate test!!! 
       
           Drake recently scoffed at K. Dot's longtime associate,  DJ Hed , after it was suggested Kendrick wasn't in a rush to disrupt the runaway success of his  Drake diss, ""Like That""  ... which has now spent 3 weeks atop Billboard's Hot 100. 
       
           Drake says Hed is being used as a blind spokesperson as Kendrick's team scrambles for answers to ""Push Ups"" -- basically, he thinks the silence is deafening!!! 
       
           Sources close to the situation tell us Kendrick is 100% going to drop ... it's just a matter of when!!!

"Chingy Music Industry Full of BS ... Don't Take The Bait, Drake & Kendrick!!!","
           Chingy  is ready for his second wind of music success, but he's wary of the industry -- telling us he's been burned by bad rumors and beef, and doesn't want to see future artists suffer the same fate!!! 
       
           TMZ Hip Hop caught up with the ""Right Thurr"" rapper ahead of the debut of his ""Unsung"" episode on TV One. He's on his ""Nu Beginnings"" wave courtesy of his brand-new single released today, but still has a sour taste in his mouth over the  Sidney Starr  situation  he says  killed his career climb. 
       
           Chingy recalls being blackballed when Sidney, a transgender model, lied about sleeping with him back in the day, and tells us her eventual apology barely did any real damage control. 
       
           The St. Louis rapper came out the gate with a multi-platinum debut in 2003, and put many bullets on the Billboard charts. 
       
           However, he says he saw, firsthand, how easily fans can forget about you when the mainstream machine isn't pumping your product. 
       
           Speaking of the mainstream, Chingy also fears  Drake  and  Kendrick Lamar 's  current clash  is getting way too intense ... and the back-and-forth stingers could escalate to violence if they're not careful. 
       
           Rap hasn't been keeping the peace as of late, but Chingy feels it can be done.

"Travis Scott I'll Be Honest, Grammys Matter ... And I Wanna Win One!!!","
           Travis Scott  says while many of his contemporaries have turned their back on the Grammys -- he's still holding out hope he can snag one ... 'cause he still finds they hold value. 
       
           The rapper got brutally honest on a new episode of  LeBron James ' show 'The Shop' -- where he basically said that he's frustrated he hasn't won a coveted statuette in his career ... despite having been nominated a whopping ten times already. 
       
           TS says he knows a lot of people in the music biz -- including  Drake ,  The Weeknd  and others -- have  thrown up two middle fingers  at the Recording Academy ... but he isn't there yet. 
       
           Travis notes that a pro in any industry -- especially competitive ones, like sports -- is in it to win it ... and he says he's no different, explaining that being recognized for his work and honored among his peers is important to him. 
       
           He goes on to say that the prestige that Grammys have historically held still carries weight in his mind -- which is why he says it sucks to get strung along for so many years without a prize, especially when you get booked to perform -- like he has many, many times. 
       
           As we reported ... Travis seemed to  throw a fit  at this year's Grammy Awards when he was snubbed once again -- lashing out on stage and breaking a lot of the stage props for his performance. 
       
           He was up for Best Rap Album and lost to  Killer Mike  ... who had  his own trouble at the Grammys . But when it comes to chasing the elusive trophy, Travis says he still wants it.

Chris Brown Takes Quavo Beef to New Level ... Wish You Died Instead of Takeoff,"
           Chris Brown 's not fooling around in his beef with  Quavo  ... dropping a new diss track -- and invoking the name of Quavo's late nephew, and Migos star,  Takeoff . 
       
           The singer-songwriter -- whose well-documented beef with Quavo's reignited in recent days -- put out his new track ""Weakest Link"" on YouTube and Instagram ... and, he's clearly going for Quavo's throat throughout the track. 
       
           And, one of his biggest disses ... ""R.I.P. Takeoff, he the only real one, I got true respect / Crazy how when he died, everybody really wished it was you instead"" -- so yeah, Brown's taking the kid gloves off. 
       
           And, it probably hits even closer to home for Quavo ... because he and Takeoff were together -- playing dice outside a Houston bowling alley -- when a man  opened fire , killing Takeoff. 
       
           Quavo publicly mourned his nephew in the years since performing in  multiple tributes  with fellow Migos rapper  Offset  ... so, this blow feels particularly low from CB. 
       
           Brown's got other bars too ... in the song, he claims he had sex with one of Quavo's past GFs while she and Q were still together -- which, if true, explains a ton of the animosity between the pair. 
       
           It's not clear who Brown's talking about in the song, but many fans and reports are pointing to  Saweetie  as the possible subject of the line. 
       
           Seems like Quavo and Brown are pretty consistently competing for ladies ... remember, Chris  rapped on his song ""Freak""  about Quavo hooking up with his ex  Karrueche Tran  -- and Quavo responded by  bringing up Brown's violence  against women. 
       
           Bottom line ... this beef's getting serious -- and, it's Quavo's move.

Kanye West Hit the Wrong Twin After Bianca Run-In ... Famous Restaurateurs,"
           The guy  Kanye West  allegedly punched in the face was one half of a set of twins who are big shots in the restaurant scene here in L.A. -- and we're told he hit the wrong one. 
       
           Eyewitnesses who were on the scene Wednesday morning at the Chateau Marmont hotel tell TMZ that what Kanye's team said about what happened -- namely,  Bianca  herself had been assaulted by the man who ran into her -- is totally off base and simply not accurate. 
       
           Here's what our sources tell us about how this went down, from their perspective ... a man accidentally bumped into Bianca in the hotel lobby, which they say was busy at the time. We're told it happened quickly, and the man went on about his way. 
       
           The guy went outside and sat at a table with friends, and we're told it was at that point Kanye approached them ... to confront the man. 
       
           At this point, we're told Kanye punched the guy in the face ... but here's the crazy part -- we're told he actually ended up punching the wrong dude -- because he's a freaking twin, and his brother was right there sitting with him as well. So, a mix-up. 
       
           As for who these twins are ... we're told  Mark  and  Jonnie Houston  are the ones who were involved -- although, we don't know which one ran into Bianca, and which was hit. If you're unfamiliar, they own a ton of restaurants in L.A. -- including a lot of celeb hot spots. 
       
           Some of the venues under their belt ... No Vacancy, Davey Wayne's, Black Rabbit Rose, and Break Room 86 ... just to name a few. We're told they frequent the Chateau. 
       
           Anyway, back to the night in question ... our sources say Kanye left after the altercation, and eventually cops showed up. As we reported ... Kanye is now a  suspect in a battery report , and police say they wanna talk to him. 
       
           Law enforcement sources confirmed this narrative to us -- and we're told the brother Kanye punched -- again, not the one who actually bumped into Bianca -- got a one-two whack to the dome ... he actually got socked TWICE (allegedly). 
       
           We're also told this ... so far, cops haven't been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye's account -- that Bianca was manhandled and spun around by the guy. We're told the case is still under investigation. 
       
           As for where things go from here, we're told once this investigation is wrapped -- it'll be sent to the City Attorney for review ... although it's unclear if anything will come of it. 
       
           We've reached out to the Houston Brothers ... no word back yet. 
       
           A rep for Kanye insists Bianca was sexually assaulted -- reiterating their claim that one of the brothers grabbed her, spun her around, and blew kisses at her ... also claiming a staff member came to check on her afterward. They add, ""This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.""

"Kanye West Jumping Into Rap Beef ... Drops Drake, J. Cole Diss","
           Kanye West 's jumped straight into rap beef ... dropping a remix of  Future  and  Kendrick Lamar 's diss track ""Like That"" -- and, taking aim at  Drake  and  J. Cole . 
       
           The controversial rapper shared a look at the new track -- titled ""Like That (Remix)"" -- on an episode of ""The Download"" hosted by his pal  Justin Laboy  ... playing the opening live on the show. 
       
           The opening features a line directly from the recently-released Future, K.dot,  Metro Boomin  track,  ""Like That""  ... which many took as a response to Drake and J. Cole's hit song ""First Person Shooter,"" igniting a pretty viral rap back-and-forth. 
       
           While Ye only played a little bit on the show ... a fuller track seems to have leaked online -- though it's unclear if this is what the final verse sounds like or if this is all fan/AI-made. 
       
           But, assuming it's real ... Kanye takes a pretty ruthless dig at both Drake and J -- rapping, ""Y'all so outta sight, outta mind / Can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole get the p***y dry / Play this s*** back 130 times."" 
       
           Not really a line that's up for interpretation here ... Ye's taking direct shots at his adversaries -- and, we gotta say he didn't miss. 
       
           And, Ye's not tamping down any of the drama surrounding the song ... instead, hopping back on X to post an NSFW J. Cole meme -- so, it looks like he's feeding into the frenzy. 
       
           He's also promising more coming soon ... so, keep your ears peeled for whatever he decides to drop next. 
       
           BTW, one more thing to note ... we don't know if Future, Kendrick and Metro signed off on this collab. Kanye has gotten in trouble in the past for  sampling songs without permission  -- so, maybe hold up speculating Kanye's back in these rapper's good graces. 
       
           Either way, it's a pretty huge slam ... and, given Drake's history in this beef, there may be a response coming very soon!!! üëÄ

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Not Shooting Scenes with Ryan ... All About Her Own Journey,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's moving on from  Ryan Anderson , and not just in her marriage ... she hasn't shared a second of camera time with him since their split, and we've learned that's not going to change anytime soon. 
       
           ""Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up"" production sources tell TMZ ... the estranged couple didn't shoot together after the breakup, and the production's going to focus more on Blanchard from here on out. 
       
           We're told the doc crew filmed the fallout between Blanchard and Anderson ... but, now it doesn't make sense to shoot them together because not only do they not live together, but quite frankly their lives are moving in totally separate directions. 
       
           Our sources are making it clear, neither Gypsy nor Ryan requested not to shoot with the other -- producers just decided on their own it didn't make sense, now that they're getting divorced. 
       
           We're told production did a one-on-one shoot with Ryan to wrap up his part in the series, but it's Gypsy's life they're interested in documenting -- and, they no longer need to shoot Ryan because he was just an extension of her. 
       
           The production's still filming, but plans on wrapping soon. 
       
           We broke the story ... Gypsy  filed for divorce  from Ryan last week, a couple weeks after  announcing her split  via social media. We've since learned she and Ryan had a  big blow-up argument  after Gypsy threw out a bunch of food Ryan hoarded, in her eyes, in their fridge. 
       
           They were married for about two years ... though Gypsy was imprisoned for almost all of that time, only  getting out  back in January. 
       
           Looks like they're putting some space between them, as cast and crew call it a wrap on Ryan's part in Gypsy's life.

Taylor Swift Calls Herself 'Functioning Alcoholic' ... In New 'TTPD' Song,"
           Taylor Swift  suggests she had a problem with alcohol in one of her new songs -- even though, frankly, she's no stranger to booze right now ... hard to tell if she's serious or not. 
       
           The singer dropped her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" Friday, which details her breakups from  Joe Alwyn  and  Matty Healy . In the opening track ""Fortnight,"" fans picked up on a lyric that paints her (or whoever she's singing as) as an alky during this time. 
       
           Taylor sings ... ""I was supposed to be sent away / But they forgot to come and get me / I was a functioning alcoholic 'til nobody noticed my new aesthetic. All of this to say, I hope you're okay / But you're the reason / And no one here's to blame / But what about your quiet treason?"" 
       
           Taylor doesn't provide any more insight into this on the song ... as a result, we really don't know if she's being literal, or simply metaphoric. What's interesting ... she notably quit drinking in the months leading up to her ""Eras"" tour -- that's what she told  TIME  Magazine anyway. 
       
           She previously told TIME she had to ditch her ""frat guy"" ways while on tour ... choosing instead to prioritize working out and a sober lifestyle so that she could be in tip-top shape for her nearly 4-hour concerts. 
       
           While Taylor might've not been boozing toward the beginning of her ""Eras"" tour -- that didn't last too long ... because as we've seen over the past several months ... Taylor has often had a drink on her for various occasions, especially when around  Travis Kelce . 
       
           We've seen Taylor pounding beers and other alcoholic beverages at various football games she's been to while  watching her boyfriend play  ... and that was definitely on display during the Super Bowl as well, where she was  having the time of her life  ... with a cup in hand. 
       
           Even during Taylor's  Bahamas vacay with Travis , she was in the water while holding a cocktail -- and this past  weekend at Coachella , folks noticed she appeared to be inebriated there too ... with lip-readers saying they saw her apologizing to TK for being drunk. 
       
           At just about every big public event Taylor's been to of late ... she's often seen drinking -- including for all the  Super Bowl after-parties , where she was raging with the team. 
       
           ""Drunk Taylor"" was also  trending during the 2023 VMAs  after fans thought the singer had a buzz on at the awards show ... so yeah, it's definitely something people notice about her. 
       
           Interestingly enough, she also seems to be aware of it -- although, in the song, she's talking about being an ""alcoholic"" in the past tense ... so, presumably, that means she used to drink even more ... again, assuming this is meant to be interpreted down to the letter. 
       
           Taylor has never looked too out of control, FWIW -- while she certainly likes to have a good time, and even a boozy time here and there, there's never been any outward signs that she doesn't know how to control herself ... or that this is actually a real issue. 
       
           Still, fans have raised eyebrows over her new alcohol comment ... and it's got folks talking.

Colorado Rockies FAA Investigating Incident On Team Charter Flight ... Coach Sat In Cockpit,"
           The Colorado Rockies are at the center of a federal investigation headed by the FAA ... after the team's hitting coach was captured on video sitting in the cockpit at the plane's controls, while the aircraft cruised at over 30,000 feet. 
       
           ""The FAA is investigating this event. Federal regulations restrict flight deck access to specific individuals,"" the Federal Aviation Administration told  TMZ Sports  in a statement. 
       
           FYI, the FAA is a federal agency under the purview of the Department of Transportation, and they're responsible for ensuring the safety of passengers who fly in America. 
       
           The incident in question occurred last week as the Rockies were traveling to Toronto for a series with the Blue Jays. 
       
           Hitting coach and former big leaguer Hensley ""Bam Bam"" Meulens snitched on himself when he posted video showing himself sitting in the captain's seat of the Boeing aircraft. 
       
           Meulens captioned the clip, ""Had some fun in the cockpit on our flight from Denver to Toronto. Thanks to the captain and the first officer of our United charter that allowed me this great experience."" 
       
           Now, the pilots have been grounded, and Bam bam could also be in trouble. 
       
           ""We‚Äôre deeply disturbed by what we see in that video, which appears to show an unauthorized person in the flight deck at cruise altitude while the autopilot was engaged,"" United Airlines told us. 
       
           ""As a clear violation of our safety and operational policies, we‚Äôve reported the incident to the FAA and have withheld the pilots from service while we conduct an investigation."" 
       
           Prior to 9/11, commercial cockpits were much more accessible. It wasn't rare for a kid to sit behind the controls before the aircraft pushed away from the gate. But, the 2001 terrorist attacks changed everything ... and that's a big no-no these days. 
       
           Even before September 11th, it was rare for a civilian to sit at the controls while the plane was in flight.

Ryan Garcia Pays Devin Haney $1.5 Million ... After Losing Weigh-In Bet,"
           Ryan Garcia 's three pounds overweight, but his pockets are certainly lighter on Friday -- the boxing star just shelled out $1.5 MILLION to  Devin Haney   after fulfilling his weigh-in bet. 
       
           Garcia placed the wager during the final press conference for their April 20th fight ... saying he would cough up $500K for every pound he's over the junior welterweight limit of 140. 
       
           Haney, (31-0) and Garcia (24-1), shook on it ... and even though Ry looked confident, his team was clearly concerned. 
       
           Rightfully so, 'cause when it came time to hit the scales on Friday, Ryan came in at 143.2 pounds .... meaning a $1.5 million check was made out to Haney, who confirmed his opponent honored the bet. 
       
           Outside of the financial hit, boxing fans were worried the whole event could be ruined ... but luckily, that's not the case. 
       
           The fight will go on as scheduled, according to boxing reporter  Michael Benson  ... and Garcia is now ineligible to win the WBC title, even if he's victorious. 
       
           This is just another wild turn in the lead-up to the fight -- since the two signed a fight deal in February, Garcia has shown erratic behavior, including  controversial messages on social media  and expletive-filled rants at press conferences.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard Debuts Smile Makeover ... No More Silvers!,"
           Gypsy Rose Blanchard 's physical transformation continues ... and next up for a makeover is her mouth ... ¬†TMZ has learned. 
       
           In new photos obtained by TMZ ... Gypsy displays her new porcelain caps, which she got to replace the silver teeth she's had for many years. Witnesses say she was spotted Wednesday at a Walmart in Galliano, LA debuting her new smile. 
       
           Remember, several of Gypsy's teeth and salivary glands were removed by her mother,  Dee Dee , after she claimed GRB was suffering from tooth decay. 
       
           Sources close to Gypsy tell TMZ ... she just recently began the long process of fixing her teeth, but it's something she's wanted to do for years. And she's received several offers from dentists following her December  release from prison  -- even  Lamar Odom  offered to  hook up Gypsy with his dentist office . 
       
           However, Gypsy decided to go to a local dentist in Louisiana, where she's been living post-prison. We're told she's had several appointments over the past month and a half, and her top teeth have officially been fitted with porcelain caps. 
       
           Her bottom teeth will be tackled next ... over the course of a few more appointments. She currently has a temporary bridge while waiting for the new caps, but we're told she's already thrilled with the results of her dental work. 
       
           This makeover revelation comes weeks after Gypsy  underwent a nose job  ... getting a combination rhinoplasty and septoplasty, which with she was equally happy. 
       
           Gypsy also, notably, got a new tattoo, getting  matching husky ink   with ex-fianc√©  Ken Urker . 
       
           It seems Gypsy has a YOLO-type attitude these days.

Patrick & Brittany Mahomes Trolled By Fans on Vacation ... Raider Nation Out in Cabo!!!,"
           Patrick  and  Brittany Mahomes  might be on vacation, but the trolls seem to find them regardless ... with some hardcore Raiders fans giving them guff as they left a restaurant. 
       
           TMZ obtained video of the pair grabbing a bite at Rosa Negra -- a luxury Latin restaurant in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico -- Thursday night, and it looked like one hot date night for the couple, sans any kids. 
       
           Eyewitnesses say the couple hung out for about two hours before dipping out ... and, that's when they got heckled by some fans of an opposing team ... with some goons booing and hissing them, not to mention shouting ""RAIDERS"" to Patty and Brit as they bounced. 
       
           It's all clearly in good fun here -- though pretty bold of LV fans to troll Mahomes to his face. But, we doubt he's sweating it ... remember, Pat  won a Super Bowl  on Raiders' home turf about two months ago -- so, ya gotta think he's got a leg up on Las Vegas these days. 
       
           BTW ... even though the couple's enjoying their vacation, it doesn't mean they've totally forgotten their friends. Brittany  posted a message in support  of her new bestie  Taylor Swift  after she dropped her  'Tortured Poets' album . 
       
           Clearly, she isn't letting the world forget they're besties now ... even from south of the border. 
       
           Anyhoo, Patrick and Brittany are having a grand time ... one that's apparently never-ending. They've been vacationing for a helluva long time now -- this is actually their  second time in Mexico  in about a month. Since winning the Super Bowl, they've been jet-setting a lot. 
       
           The season doesn't start for a while ... so enjoy it while ya can!

Kelly Oubre Jr. Shades Knicks Ahead Of Playoffs Celeb Row Doesn't Care!!!,"
           Philadelphia 76ers hooper  Kelly Oubre Jr.  just gave the New York Knicks some bulletin board material ahead of their playoff matchup ... claiming the famous fans at Madison Square Garden couldn't give two craps about the games. 
       
           KO fired off the hot take at Sixers practice on Friday ... initially praising the diehard supporters and the basketball atmosphere in the Big Apple -- before turning heel REAL quick. 
       
           ""The fans are pretty crazy,"" Oubre told reporters. ""They have a really good culture of being wild and loving basketball to the root and the core of it. It's definitely called the 'Mecca of Basketball' for a reason. The lights are super bright."" 
       
           High praise, right?? Well, here's where it got spicy ... 
       
           ""They're gonna give celebrities those $100,000 tickets just to be there and not care about the game,"" Oubre added. ""But that's what they do."" 
       
           ""Entourage"" star  Jerry Ferrara  got wind of Oubre's comments ... and he made it clear Oubre is dead wrong, even slamming the Sixers fanbase for, in his opinion, disappearing during their rebuilding years. 
       
           ""We show up and are loud when the team is bad,"" Ferrara said. ""Can't imagine many people showed up during the process."" 
       
           He didn't stop there -- ""To the Sixers players. Please please please keep doing your interviews and talking your s***. We all know you have a rich playoff history the last 10 years."" 
       
           Celebrity Row is a big tradition for the Knicks ... with countless A-listers getting courtside access. Something tells us  Spike Lee  won't take Oubre's words lightly. 
       
           Ferrara said he was already pumped for the series ... but he's even more excited now, thanks to the ""Sixers role players chirping in a dumb ass way."" 
       
           The Knicks host the Sixers for Game 1 of the first-round series at 3 PM on Saturday ... and Oubre can expect a loud MSG.

Andy Ruiz Ex Gets Permanent Restraining Order ... Against Star Boxer,"
           Andy Ruiz 's ex has won her court battle with the star boxer ...  TMZ Sports  has learned a judge granted her a permanent restraining order earlier this month against the former heavyweight champ. 
       
           Julia Lemus  had been  seeking the order of protection  since April 2023 ... after she alleged Ruiz sexually assaulted, abused, and terrorized her throughout their relationship. 
       
           In her application for the order, Lemus -- who began seeing Ruiz around 2016 -- said the 34-year-old would often grab and yank her to move her wherever he wanted her to go. She also claimed he would ""jokingly"" punch her in her arms and legs, leaving her with bruises. 
       
           Lemus also said Ruiz pointed an AK-47 at her face during a 2023 incident ... after she said she told him she felt uncomfortable with a recent firearm purchase he had made. 
       
           In addition, Lemus said Ruiz began sexually assaulting her that same year, forcing himself onto her on at least six occasions. 
       
           She was granted a temporary restraining order after making the allegations, but when Ruiz adamantly denied the claims -- and later hired famed attorney  Camille Vasquez  to represent him -- the two went to court to determine if a permanent one should be put in place. 
       
           Both parties testified in front of a judge -- as did multiple witnesses. And, ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Lemus on April 8 -- granting her a 3-year restraining order that she will have the ability to renew upon request. 
       
           In making her ruling, Judge  Sharon L. Kalemkiarian  wrote in court documents she determined the evidence showed Lemus ""is in fear as a result of aggressive, demeaning and controlling behavior by Mr. Ruiz."" 
       
           ""Mr. Ruiz did assault her,"" Kalemkiarian added, ""did disturb her peace, and did exercise coercive control throughout the entire relationship."" 
       
           As part of her order, Kalemkiarian ruled Ruiz must stay 100 yards away from Lemus, her home, her job, and her vehicle. She also ordered Ruiz to have no guns ... and to take a 12-week anger management program. 
       
           The judge gave sole custody of the couple's two children to Lemus, too -- noting he could have supervised visits with the children. 
       
           The order is slated to remain in place until April 8, 2027.

"Mohamed Hadid Apologizes to Congressman ... Racist, Homophobic Comments","
           Mohamed Hadid 's apologizing for racist and homophobic direct messages he sent to Congressman  Ritchie Torres  ... while still criticizing Torres for supporting Israel. 
       
           The real estate developer -- and father to  Gigi   and  Bella Hadid  -- posted to Instagram to address DMs he sent to the congressman ... revealed by the  New York Post   Saturday. 
       
           Among the unsavory insults ... Mohamed said Ritchie was dumber than New York sewer rats, said he should dress in a KKK hood to cover his face and he might be qualified to be a bouncer at a gay bar. 
       
           Torres became the first openly gay, Afro-Latino man elected to Congress ... so, Mohamed's comments are very pointed at his identity. 
       
           Mohamed starts off by saying he's not apologizing for his anger but for the words he used to express himself ... though he quickly goes on the attack against Torres saying he's a shill for the Israeli government. 
       
           Mohamed says he's upset he became a refugee from the country so many years ago, and he's angry at the genocide unfolding ... making a note to apologize to the Palestinian community for shifting the conversation away from the violence in the region. 
       
           Basically, Mohamed's apologizing, but not really to Torres. Instead, he's still slamming Ritchie's political beliefs ... and, acknowledges he should've used different words to do so earlier. 
       
           Mohamed's daughters have been outspoken about their support for Palestine with Gigi and Bella both  posing in the aftermath  of the October 7 attack ... and, the family received death threats for their support of Palestine. 
       
           BTW ... Torres isn't forgiving Hadid -- telling the Post Mohamed hurled just about every insult he could at RT short of calling him the n-word, adding he dehumanized Ritchie. 
       
           Sounds like the two won't be burying the hatchet anytime soon.

           Paste, an entertainment/culture outlet, published  its review  of ""The Tortured Poets Department"" Friday ... but didn't include a specific author's name in the byline. 
       
           The magazine included an editor's note on its account ... saying when it reviewed ""Lover"" back in 2019 the writer who penned the piece received threats of violence -- and, the mag didn't want to put an employee in danger. 
       
           Probably a good call ... 'cause the review absolutely trashes Swift's 11th studio album -- saying it infantilizes its audience and comparing it to controversial poet  Rupi Kaur 's work. 
       
           The opening line sets the tone for the entire piece ... with the writer starting off by saying, ""Sylvia Plath did not stick her head in an oven for this!"" -- so, yeah the review's pretty critical. 
       
           But, Paste's review ain't stopping people from listening to the album ... 'cause 'TTPD' reportedly made history when it became the first album to garner more than 300 million Spotify streams in just one day. 
       
           BTW ... people online have mixed reactions to Paste's decision -- with some saying her fans should be allowed to debate with a person who's criticizing their fav artist while others applauded Paste for protecting their writer. 
       
           Paste better be careful though ... or they might end up getting name-dropped in Taylor's 12th album!

           The actress spoke with  Page Six  earlier this week in a new video posted Sunday ... and, she stood up for her pal -- saying she gets so much hate for seemingly no reason.

           Meghan and Melissa have been friends for years ... remember, back in 2021 the pair made a video together to promote Markle's mentorship program entitled 40√ó40 -- which joked about her royal status.

           Stevenson, 21-0, joined  Babcock  on the "" TMZ Sports"" TV show  (airs nightly on  FS1 ) ahead of the Haney vs. Garcia fight on Saturday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn ... and we asked Shakur for his thoughts. 
       
           ""I kinda think [Ryan's] not focused. I don't think that he's really taking the fight serious,"" Stevenson said. 
       
           ""It seems like he's more focused on selling the fight than actually working and making sure that he's coming 100% ready for the fight. I don't think it's an act."" 
       
           Of course, Shakur's referring to Ryan's  erratic prefight behavior  ... Garcia has worried many fans and followers alike with his erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to the fight. 
       
           Despite those calls, the fight's not getting canceled ... so we asked Shakur to give Ryan a blueprint to victory. 
       
           ""I think that he should go at Devin. I think that he shouldn't go in there waiting in boxing. He should go at him like he went at Tank and try to land his right hand."" 
       
           SS continued ... ""I think that Devin keeps his left hand down a lot, so try to land the right hand, not just the hook. I think Devin is prepared for the hook."" 
       
           Can he do it is the question ... and Stevenson believes it's highly unlikely, especially 'cause he isn't all that impressed with Ry on his best day. 
       
           ""I don't think that he's even on the elite level. I think that he's not really that good of a fighter."" 
       
           We also asked Shakur how Devin wins. 
       
           ""I think Devin just goes in there and does what he's been doing. I think he's just boxed his way to victory. He may even be able to catch Ryan, especially with Ryan being not as focused as he should have been."" 
       
           Shakur says he won't be in the building for the fight, but he's eagerly waiting to watch from home ... and he's very hopeful he'll be able to reach an agreement with Haney that'll pit them against each other in the near future. 
       
           ""I see myself fighting Devin. I think that's the fight.""

           Luke Bryan's proving the show must go on ... 'cause he slipped during last night's performance and crashed to the ground hard -- but, took the incident in stride. 
       
           The country music singer-songwriter performed at the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver last night ... and while hyping up his next song Bryan stepped in the wrong spot and went flying into the air. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Bryan looks like a cartoon stepping on a banana peel, really getting some height on his slip -- and, revealing he actually stepped on someone's phone. 
       
           LB could've gotten seriously hurt, but he pops up pretty quickly and laughs it off ... before asking if anyone had captured the insane moment. 
       
           Of course, pretty much everyone in the front row had cameras trained on Bryan ... and, he borrowed a fan's phone to show a clip of his fall on the big screen for the entire stadium to enjoy. 
       
           Anyhoo ... Luke and the crowd laughed about the incident and moved on -- and, Bryan probably handled it so well because it's not the first time he's eaten it during a performance. 
       
           Remember ... TMZ  obtained video  back in 2014 of Luke rockin' out at a concert in North Carolina before stepping too far forward -- and, literally face-planting offstage. People rushed over to help him back then, and he got a few stitches, but ultimately he was fine. 
       
           And, there's this from 2022 ... where Bryan showed off some booty-poppin' dance moves -- when his ankle gave out and left him fully on his back. 
       
           BTW ... Bryan's got a show Wednesday in Saskatchewan, Canada -- watch your step, Luke!!!

           If you don't know ... Targaryens have traditionally been shown as white with blonde hair -- so, the inclusion of Black actors in these particular roles has received some racist vitriol online.

Taylor Swift Smooches Travis Kelce In 'Fortnight' Vid,"
           Taylor Swift  can't hide she's totally smitten with BF  Travis Kelce  in her new YouTube promotional clip for her first music video, ""Fortnight,"" off her recently released 11th album. 
       
           The pop superstar's short, but sweet YT montage shows various parts of her personal life as the ""Fortnight"" track plays in the background with Travis appearing almost instantly. 
       
           The clip begins with Taylor rocking out in the studio, then cuts to Travis giving her a smooch as she cooks in the kitchen. 
       
           Other images capture Taylor exercising, sewing, hanging out on a boat with friends, making cinnamon buns, and hitting the pickleball courts -- with a paddle emblazoned with Trav's Kansas City Chiefs logo. 
       
           The vid also highlights her and Trav under a massive tree -- which is located at Supertree Grove in Singapore. 
       
           You may recall, in March Taylor and Travis shared an intimate date at Supertree Grove as part of an international leg of her 'Eras' tour. The NFL star  traveled across the world  to see Taylor perform in Singapore, leaving little doubt about their commitment. 
       
           But Taylor's not giving any love to her ex  Joe Alwyn  on her new album, ""The Tortured Poets Department,"" which was officially released Friday. 
       
           In one song, ""So Long London,"" Taylor  rips into Alwyn  for his alleged depression, which she seemingly attributes to their break-up. 
       
           Taylor also took a major shot at  Kim Kardashian  in another tune, 'thanK you aIMee,""  comparing the reality star to a schoolyard bully  and reigniting their feud from years ago.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Residence Broken Into ... While She Was Home!!!,"
           Los Angeles Mayor  Karen Bass  received a nasty surprise this morning ... 'cause LAPD says an individual broke into her residence -- while she was home. 
       
           The Los Angeles Police Department announced the news late Sunday afternoon ... posting to X a person broke into the Getty House, the official residence of the mayor, at around 6:40 AM Sunday. 
       
           While they confirmed occupants were in the home at the time, they wouldn't say exactly who ... but, law enforcement sources tell us Mayor Bass was one of them. 
       
           LAPD says no one was injured, and they took a suspect into custody without incident ... still, a scary situation for Mayor Bass. 
       
           Bass -- who served in Congress from 2011 to 2022 before resigning the office to take over the mayoral job in L.A. -- is a close friend and advocate for President  Joe Biden . 
       
           It's hard not to remember the break-in at  Nancy Pelosi 's San Francisco home back in 2022 ... when her husband  Paul Pelosi  was  bludgeoned with a hammer  by  David DePape . 
       
           It's unclear at this time if the break-in at Bass' residence was politically motivated. 
       
           The Mayor's office released a statement as well ... confirming what cops announced on X and adding, ""The Mayor is grateful to LAPD for responding and arresting the suspect."" 
       
           We're told LAPD's elite Robbery and Homicide division is investigating the case.

           Jonathan Lepore  is selling the business account card over at  Goldin Auctions  ... telling TMZ he snagged the piece of plastic, which expired in 2023, on eBay last summer for a steal at $70, adding it to his trove of sports memorabilia. 
       
           Later, Jonathan planned to gift the card to his pal's dad, who apparently used to chill with O.J. and  Nicole Brown Simpson  in the Hamptons during the '80s and early '90s. 
       
           But he tells us he hadn't bumped into him since ... and kinda, sorta forgot he even had it -- until, that is, the news of  O.J.'s passing  over a week ago jogged his memory. 
       
           As for the card itself, it displays mild peripheral wear and small spots of light discoloration -- also it hasn't been signed on the reverse side. 
       
           Goldin founder & CEO  Ken Goldin  draws on O.J. being responsible for some of the most memorable/horrific moments in our lifetimes, telling TMZ, ""With OJ's recent passing, this card is a small piece of that story and we could see some exciting numbers at auction."" 
       
           And as for Jonathan, he's not just cashing in on a piece of OJ memorabilia -- he's turning it into a force for good. He plans on donating 10% of the final sale to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. The auction ends Thursday.

           Harrington knows his stuff -- the guy built an entire company around his love for Mary Jane ... serving as the CEO of the Viola brand. 
       
           He's doing pretty well for himself, too ... with the company valued at over $100 million. 
       
           Harrington -- who played 16 seasons in the league for a number of teams -- told us he'll be in NYC for a three-day ""4/20 Tour"" this weekend ... 'cause apparently, the dude needs way more than 24 hours to show his love for cannabis. 
       
           Harrington has been a huge advocate for the benefits of marijuana -- in 2017, he sat down with former NBA commish  David Stern  ... and the conversation helped the league eventually take weed off the banned substances list. 
       
           As for folks looking to dabble with some doobies, Harrington says there's no need to complicate it ... just puff, puff, pass and enjoy yourself.

Jim Harbaugh Check Out My New Ink ... Fulfills Tattoo Promise,"
           Jim Harbaugh 's a man of his word ... fulfilling a promise he made to ink his body if they won a national championship -- and his players filmed the whole experience. 
       
           The Michigan Wolverines football team met up Saturday to receive their national championship rings ... and, JH lived up to his end of the deal -- sitting down with an artist and getting the Michigan ""M"" tatted on his right arm. 
       
           After Michigan defeated the Washington Huskies in the title game 34-13 back in January, Jim revealed he'd promised his team he'd tattoo their logo with the record ""15-0"" as a shout-out to their accomplishment. 
       
           Welp, no one can accuse Harbaugh of being all talk 'cause his star cornerback  Mike Sainristil  -- who many expect to go top 50 in this year's draft -- took a vid of the tattoo session ... but, Jim doesn't look like he's loving it. 
       
           Check out the clip ... Harbaugh's got a pretty discontent look on his face -- not surprising given it's his first tattoo. He's staring down the camera the whole time, only cracking a grin once it seems the tattoo's finished up. 
       
           It's a ceremonial end for Harbaugh who  took the head coaching gig  for the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after pulling off the immaculate season. 
       
           BTW ... some upset fans are coming after Harbaugh on X 'cause cheating allegations marred the 15-0 season. Remember, Jim  served a three-game suspension  for a sign-stealing scandal despite expressing his innocence.

           Brenden has been a baller receiver at USC for the last two years -- but he's now entering the NFL draft ... and he says when he gets on his new team next week, he doesn't want anyone to compare him to his dad.

           In one of the photos, Sweeney was sporting a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, ""Sorry For Having Great T**s."" 
       
           The titillating message appears to be in response to Hollywood movie producer  Carol Baum , who disparaged Sweeney's looks and  slammed her performance  in the comedy, ""Anyone But You."" 
       
           Baum, who is also a professor at USC, made her ugly remarks about Sweeney to film critic  Janet Maslin  during an event in New York. 
       
           She told Maslin that she caught ""Anyone But You"" during a flight, calling the flick ""unwatchable."" 
       
           She also recalled bringing up Sweeney to her USC class, saying, ""Explain this girl to me. She's not pretty, she can't act. Why is she so hot?""

Over the years, Baum has produced several successful films, such as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Dead Ringers.""

Kid Cudi Breaks Foot After jumping Off Coachella stage,"

           He says it's a major setback but reiterates to his fans that he's OK, and will still be touring in the coming months as long as he gets his doctor's approval. Safe to say he's learned his lesson. 
       
           Kid Cudi cut his Coachella set short Sunday ... after breaking a bone by jumping off the stage. 
       
           Late into his performance on the Sahara stage, the rapper was getting off the platform ... noticeably swaying back and forth. At one point, Kid Cudi jumped down hard off the stage -- and was struggling to get up. 
       
           KC found help as 2 security guards tried to help him walk it off -- but he was unable to finish the performance. 
       
           It appears Cudi did some damage -- he told his fans on X he broke his foot. 
       
           Cudi  said , ""Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big."" 
       
           Though Kid Cudi's set ended early, the crowd wasn't too shortchanged. Cudi only had one and a half songs left in his Sunday set. 
       
           The Coachella live stream -- which documented Kid Cudi's injury -- proceeded to play a recording of his hit, ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" to make up for his absence. 
       
           KC couldn't say goodbye to his fans ¬†... some of whom seemed super confused. 
       
           This was Kid Cudi's first time back at Coachella since 2019 ... so it's a bummer. 
       
           It was a rough weekend for musicians ...  Luke Bryan  took a  hard fall onstage  during the Coast City Country Festival in Vancouver. Unlike Cudi, LB was left unscathed from his fall ... he even laughed off the whole thing!!!

           It's unclear when Saleh was loading up on the golden owl gear, but Drake pushed the issue on Kendrick's response with his caption -- ""Are we getting in our bag or nah??"" 
       
           Drake also posted an up close and personal Saleh selfie littered with turtle emojis where he asked, ""Wonder if today is the day"" ... indicating Kendrick and camp have been moving too slow for his taste. 
       
           Drake's ""Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)"" diss has been getting positive reviews across the internet and on the demo version, he openly dared Kendrick to release the vent track he's supposedly been letting collect dust for 4 years. 
       
           Saleh may be busy at the moment -- his other clients  Nas  and  Future  are in the middle of album runs, and Kendrick AI tracks are clogging up the conversations daily.

           During Sunday's episode of ""90 Day Fianc√©: Happily Ever After?"" Big Ed explains his decision to pull the plug on his forthcoming nuptials to his on-again, off-again love. 
       
           As he puts it, he and Liz had an argument over taco pasta ... leaving Ed seriously pissed off. 
       
           He says, ""I think Liz actually is waiting for me to call her up and say I‚Äôm sorry like it‚Äôs always been. I call, I apologize, okay, and we move on. And, that‚Äôs how the last 14 breakups have been."" 
       
           But, according to Ed, this heated fight made him realize he and Liz just aren't meant to be. 
       
           While Ed shares his reasoning with the '90 Day' cameras, Liz claims she was blindsided by her fianc√©'s decision. From her perspective, Ed bailed without a word the morning after their disagreement, canceling the nuptials without telling her first. 
       
           Per Liz, she discovered her wedding was off via a text from her officiant -- blaming Ed's cold feet for the whole situation. 
       
           Liz slams Ed as a ""coward"" and a ""weakling"" for the way he went about canceling their wedding. She adds, ""I don't think I could have shown this man any more effort, that he means everything to me."" 
       
           As for whether Liz and Ed's 15th breakup was their last??? Liz has been noticeably MIA from Ed's Instagram in recent months.

Tekashi 6ix9ine Florida Home Hit By IRS Agents ... Couple of His Cars Seized,"
           Tekashi 6ix9ine  appears to have run into more legal trouble here in the States -- because we've learned federal agents rolled up to his house ... and rolled away with his cars. 
       
           The Palm Beach Sheriff's Office tells TMZ they were dispatched to Tekashi's home in Lake Worth, FL Wednesday to assist IRS agents conducting an operation there. PBSO wouldn't give us more info on the exact nature of the operation, but there are some pretty clear clues. 
       
           According to photos/videos obtained by TMZ of the visit -- one for which Tekashi himself was not home, we've confirmed -- it looks like the agents were there to seize his stuff. 
       
           Eyewitnesses tell us that these agents ended up confiscating multiple items from Tekashi's house -- where other people could be seen talking with the agents outside -- and it looks like they even towed away some of the vehicles at the property, too. 
       
           We've been told that several different cars of his were hauled off, but we've obtained photos of at least two that look like they were for sure seized. You can even see they have his name right there on a sticker on the windshield of one of the rides. 
       
           In terms of what exactly this is all about, it's still unclear. Of course, the fact the IRS is in the mix -- ya gotta figure it's tax-related... but the IRS hasn't gotten back to us yet. 
       
           In terms of where Tekashi is right now -- well, you'll recall ... he's dealing with  legal problems  down in the Dominican Republic, where he's been spending a lot of time lately. We're hearing from sources with direct knowledge that he's still in the D.R. and isn't in the U.S. 
       
           His attorney,  Lance Lazzaro , tells TMZ ... ""We are assessing the situation and will issue a statement at the appropriate time.""

"Coachella Weekend 1 Less Rowdy Than Last Year ... Fewer Arrests, Citations","
           It looks like people were better behaved at Coachella Weekend 1 this year ... because arrests were down significantly compared to last year, TMZ has learned. 
       
           Indio PD released their data from the festival's first installment ... and they say they only clocked 81 arrests in their system between Friday and Sunday -- which is pretty damn low compared to years past, especially 2023. 
       
           That's down 20% from the 102 arrests made last year. There was also a small smattering of citations issued -- just 47 -- and they're all handicap parking related ... down 43% from last year. 
       
           Still, there was some bad behavior at Coachella this past weekend. Per IPD ... 28 arrests were made regarding drug and alcohol intoxication, as well as an additional 28 arrests for possession of drugs for sale. 
       
           The cops say they made 18 arrests relating to fake IDs ... but there were only 3 arrests made for property crimes. Cops also want festival-goers to still keep an eye on their cell phones ... as it sounds like there were a lot went missing during the weekend. 
       
           As for the remaining 4 arrests ... those were dropped under an ""Other"" category, so who the hell knows what those could be. 
       
           While it's reassuring to hear how relatively well-behaved everyone was for Weekend 1 ... it does follow the trend from previous years. Remember, in 2022, weekend 2 saw  significantly rowdier crowds  ... with 36% more arrests taking place after weekend 1. 
       
           Perhaps the dip in crime has something to do with Coachella's ticket sales being down??? Fewer people may just translate into fewer overall incidents ... that logic tracks with us. 
       
           We'll have to wait for the weekend 2 data to prove our theory. Stay tuned!

Jeezy Clarifies Custody Request ... Wants Joint w/ Parenting Schedule,"
           Jeezy  is clearing the air on his bid for primary custody of his kid -- now asking the judge to make sure he and  Jeannie Mai  each get their fair share of parental time. 
       
           In a new motion, obtained by TMZ ... Jeezy claims his estranged wife is restricting his access to their daughter, 2-year-old  Monaco . 
       
           The rapper says he and Jeannie worked out an informal custody agreement last year, but that fell apart at the beginning of 2024 ... and he claims he's barely seen Monaco this whole year. 
       
           Jeezy says they agreed to let him take Monaco for spring break from March 3 to March 9 -- but, when he sent someone to pick up his daughter for another visit at the beginning of April, she wasn't at the home he and Jeannie shared. 
       
           In fact, Jeezy claims Jeannie and Monaco have moved out of the home, and he says he often has no idea where the child is -- something he says violates their agreement. 
       
           He also claims regular FaceTime calls aren't possible because Jeannie blocked his number. 
       
           BTW ... Jeezy also says Jeannie's claiming his gun ownership is the reason she doesn't want her daughter seeing him -- which he says isn't fair because he's always owned guns and has never put their daughter in harm's way. 
       
           Remember, this all comes after  Jeezy filed docs  asking the court for primary custody of Monaco ... but, sources close to him claim he's always wanted joint custody in the long term. 
       
           Jeezy's asking for a hearing to hash out a temporary parenting schedule -- one which will equally split time between the parents.

GloRilla Arrested for DUI in Georgia ... Cops Say Boob Popped Out,"
           GloRilla  found herself in a jail cell this week after cops busted her for DUI -- and she apparently had a wardrobe malfunction while this all went down ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           According to a police report, obtained by TMZ, the rapper was arrested and booked early Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, consuming/possessing an open alcoholic beverage container and a separate traffic charge in Gwinnett County, GA. 
       
           She was hauled into jail around 6:12 AM ET and bonded out a few hours later. Her booking info, obtained by TMZ, notes that one of her aliases is Hallelujah ... which is her legal middle name. 
       
           As for what exactly happened here -- cops say they saw a vehicle making a U-turn at a solid red traffic light around 4 AM ET, so they pulled the vehicle over to see what was what. 
       
           The officer who took the report claims he smelled marijuana and alcohol emanating from the car, and claims GloRilla told him she'd been drinking that evening ... but, he explains she wouldn't say how much she'd consumed, and insisted she was good to drive. 
       
           The police say they then administered a field sobriety test -- which they claim GloRilla was shaky on, especially staying on her feet. They put her through the wringer, it seems -- making her do the eye-follow test, the walk-and-turn, one-leg balance, walk-in-a-straight-line, etc. 
       
           On just about all of them ... the cops claim she bombed. Finally, they got to the breathalyzer ... which the police claim she refused to submit to. During this whole back and forth, the cop says GloRilla's breast slipped out from under her clothes -- which he had to tell her about. 
       
           In the end, GloRilla got arrested -- and cops say an associate came to pick up her vehicle. 
       
           What's interesting is that GloRilla herself hasn't shown any indication she ran into legal trouble. Her IG is full of people twerking their asses to her and  Megan Thee Stallion 's new 'Wanna Be' song. So, business as usual in other words. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla ... so far, no word back.

Ashanti I'm Preggo with Nelly's Baby ... And We're Engaged Too!!!,"
           2:33 PM PT  -- According to  Essence ,  Nelly  and  Ashanti  are also engaged -- so big day for them. 
       
           Ashanti says, ""This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope, and anticipation. Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fianc√©, and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience."" 
       
           Ashanti is finally confirming what we've suspected for months now ... she and Nelly are indeed expecting a child together! 
       
           On Wednesday, Ashanti posted a comedy skit on Instagram, which showed her momager  Tina Douglas  rushing her to the stage ahead of a concert at Barclays Center. 
       
           When Tina asked how much time she needed to get ready, Ashanti coyly replied ""9 months"" ... and also captioned the post ""Baby, baby, baby, baby"" and clearly wasn't referencing her 2002 hit!!! 
       
           It was Nelly who first tipped off fans -- way  back in December  -- when he gleefully kept rubbing on Ashanti's belly. It wasn't hard for folks to connect the dots, but now they've made it official. 
       
           The family news has been a long time coming -- the couple initially started dating in 2003!!! 
       
           We got soon-to-be uncle  Ja Rule  to give Ashanti and Nelly  some parenting advice  not too long ago. Doing his best Hallmark card impression, Ja told us the main ingredient for a healthy family recipe is love. 
       
           Congratulations to the happy couple! Musical prodigy now uploading.

           Will.i.am  is set to be a proud graduate of Harvard Business School -- an education, he says, his years of boom boom powing the music industry could have never taught him -- and he's ready to school people on the pros of AI!!! 
       
           TMZ Hip Hop recently caught up with Will in NYC, where he praised Harvard's Owner/President Management program for its influence on his  FYI app . 
       
           Will sounded like he's reading a computer syntax error at times -- dropping acronyms like NLP, NLU and OPM -- but it was clear he's excited to help create a world boosted by AI ... and he's urging the general public not to fear the innovation. 
       
           Will points out the invention of the calculator didn't disrupt human advancement, and notes today's buildings are made by AI programs ... it's all about making life easier. 
       
           He says deep convos about AI are exactly what will prevent it from taking over ... which is the approach he wishes we'd taken when social media launched.

Halle Bailey Still Together with DDG ... Despite Breakup Rumors,"
           Halle Bailey  and  DDG , the father of her child, have not gone their separate ways and are not broken up -- even though the internet certainly seems to think they did ... TMZ has learned. 
       
           The singer's rep tells us Halle and DDG are still together and that all the reports they've split are straight-up false -- point blank. The reason this even had to be addressed is because folks were running rampant with rumors that they'd thrown in the towel recently. 
       
           There were definitely indications there, perhaps, was trouble in paradise ... including the fact that they'd recently unfollowed each other on Instagram, which is kind of a big deal in 2024. 
       
           Not just that, but people noticed they seem to have scrubbed most of their pics as a pair. 
       
           Lastly, there's the fact Halle was just at Coachella last weekend to support her big sister,  Chloe , during her performance ... and DDG was noticeably absent, both in shots Halle posted herself and in footage of Halle watching Chloe's set. She looked to be all by her lonesome. 
       
           We asked Halle's rep about the unfollowing on IG, but haven't gotten an answer on that just yet. Still, her team is firm and clear with us -- saying they're still going strong, even now. 
       
           Of course, the reason this was a huge deal is because Halle and DDG  recently welcomed a baby  into the world together ... and they were one of Hollywood's most beloved couples. 
       
           Halle hasn't posted the kid's face just yet -- but she has been teasing him in a bunch of shots online ... including one she threw up just a couple weeks ago, which also featured DDG in what appears to be a sweet family photo. They were vacationing together, it seems. 
       
           Halle also recently included DDG in a photo dump to celebrate her 24th birthday. 
       
           The last time we saw Halle and DDG together in public was back in March, where they posed together in front of cameras for an event. 
       
           DDG and Halle themselves haven't addressed all the speculation personally ... but her camp is speaking for her now, and they're saying this is all much ado about nothing. End of story.

Kevin Liles Gunna Will Survive Hip Hop Opinions!!! Defends the 'Diddy I Know',"
           Kevin Liles  is confident  Gunna 's next project will be a winner, but he also thinks his prot√©g√© is getting a bad rap from the hip hop community!!! 
       
           The Chairman and CEO of 300 Elektra Entertainment tells TMZ Hip Hop the music Gunna has been putting out reflects his real-life circumstances -- being accused of snitching on his homie  Young Thug . 
       
           The rumors haven't hurt Gunna's music traction at all ... the Atlanta rapper has more than 35 million monthly streams on Spotify, his last album went gold and he has a new one titled ""One of Wun"" on the way. 
       
           We recently quizzed Gunna on what to look forward to -- he didn't have much deets, but promised to put TMZ in an upcoming music vid. Gee, thanks?! 
       
           Kevin calls the success ""bittersweet"" -- a slick choice of words seeing that it's the name of Gunna's new single, but he knows judges and juries are lurking everywhere regarding Black culture. 
       
           From mogul to mogul, we also got Kevin's take on the ongoing  Diddy  drama. The two have run in the same industry circles for years ... a point KL doesn't deny because he says  the allegations  don't match up to the guy he knows!!!

           YG's back in the saddle with his day one collaborator  Mustard , and L.A. radio is about to experience a revival of sorts -- they're releasing the upcoming compilation, ""Just Re'd Up 3"" soon and point him to the action!!! 
       
           Hip Hop has been offering tons of just that as of late, and we had to get his thoughts on Kendrick Lamar vs. Everybody, including his homie J. Cole. 
       
           YG has records with both Kendrick and Cole but didn't come down on the Dreamville rapper for apologizing like  other culture critics . 
       
           He's thinking like a boss more than ever. YG and his label recently inked a multi-album partnership deal with BMG, after officially departing Def Jam Records -- so, more than ever, his career is his to control.

GloRilla DUI Arrest on Body Cam Video ... Does Several Sobriety Tests,"
           GloRilla  got put through the gauntlet of a typical DUI arrest -- having to do a bunch of field sobriety tests for the responding officer ... which we can now see on video. 
       
           TMZ has obtained the body cam footage from Tuesday night in Gwinnett County, GA -- where cops pulled her over and ultimately  took her to jail  and booked her on suspicion of driving under the influence, among other charges. 
       
           Now, we can see exactly how the whole thing played out on camera -- and you can tell right from the get-go the officer here wasn't gonna let her off the hook, despite GloRilla insisting she was okay to drive. The cop wasn't buying that, and made her get out of the car. 
       
           BTW, worth noting ... GloRilla does tell the officer she had a gun in the car -- but it doesn't sound like one was ever found, there's no mention of a firearm in the police report ... nor was she booked on any weapons charges. So, it's unclear if GloRilla simply misspoke. 
       
           Anyway, once GloRilla is out of the vehicle ... the officers make her do a bunch of things to prove she's not intoxicated -- including balance tests, walking straight, etc. 
       
           GloRilla asks for clarification multiple times, but to our eye ... she actually does pretty decently on most of these. Of course, the cops felt differently ... and eventually, they asked her to voluntarily submit to a breathalyzer, which GloRilla refuses to do here in the video. 
       
           In the end, we know how this all worked out ... GloRilla was hauled to jail, where she posed for a mug shot and sat in the drunk tank until it was time to cut her loose. 
       
           She hasn't addressed the arrest yet ... but there's no hiding from it now. BTW, the moment GloRilla's boob popped out during this entire interaction shows up here too ... and she hardly noticed it until the cop pointed it out. 
       
           We've reached out to GloRilla's team ... no word back yet.

Shyne I Was Fall Guy for '99 Shooting ... But Won't Blame Diddy,"
           Shyne  says he 100% was the fall guy in the 1999 NYC club shooting, for which he did time, ¬†-- and while the shooting victim is pointing the finger at  Diddy  ... Shyne isn't quite going there. 
       
           The ex-Bad Boy star -- who did about 8 years in prison over the infamous incident -- spoke to  the media  this week down in Belize ... where he's now an elected member of the House of Representatives. 
       
           It's fascinating ... Shyne says he's tried putting the whole saga behind him, but the renewed online buzz about it -- thanks to  Rodney Jones' lawsuit  against Diddy -- has opened old wounds, but he's maintaining his innocence. 
       
           Shyne has been on this drumbeat for years, BTW ... insisting he didn't do it and that he took the fall for someone else -- although, he once again stops short of blaming Puff. 
       
           And yet, if you listen to him here, he does urge folks to watch recent videos posted by  Natania Reuben  ... the woman who was shot 25 years ago in the nightclub. 
       
           If you haven't seen them yet ... Natania has posted multiple clips where she details the saga from her POV -- she was shot in the face, and makes no bones about accusing Diddy of pulling the trigger. 
       
           Natania says she's been telling this to anyone who'll listen since it happened -- even though Diddy was never charged for doing so. 
       
           The D.A. hit Diddy with gun possession and bribery charges, related to the incident -- but he was acquitted of all charges. Shyne, meanwhile, was convicted over the shooting ¬†... and like we said, he served time. 
       
           You'll recall ... this all happened while Diddy and  Jennifer Lopez  were dating, and while she was present that night, she was not charged or accused of any crime. 
       
           Like we said, Shyne doesn't go so far as to cosign on Natania's remarks, even though he encouraged people to watch them. 
       
           He does say he wishes Diddy well and he appreciates everything Diddy has done for Belize in the years since -- so, they're certainly friendly. They even performed together last year in Europe. 
       
           Of course, the reason this is all under a microscope anew is because Diddy is being  investigated by the feds  over a number of things -- and he's in the crosshairs of an ongoing probe. 
       
           Diddy has denied all the allegations in the lawsuits filed against him, and he hasn't been charged with any crime.

           Fans of the rapper have since rallied around Nicki ... defending it was inappropriate for the fan to throw the object. 
       
           However, others expressed concern about a potential lawsuit for the chart-topper. 
       
           Still, there's been a disturbing trend of artists being hit in the face with unwanted items in recent years. Remember, last June,  Bebe Rexha  was left with a black eye after a fan threw their phone at the singer in the hope of getting a photo. 
       
           That same summer,  Pink   was left speechless after one of her fans  threw their mom's ashes  onstage. 
       
           Cardi B  narrowly  avoided charges  after she  threw a mic  at a fan after a drink was thrown at her during a Las Vegas performance. 
       
           Harry Styles  has been hit while performing on more than one occasion. Notably, Skittles made a public plea in 2022 after the One Direction alum was pelted with the candy during one of his shows.

Kanye West Suspect in LAPD Battery Report ... Guy Allegedly Grabbed Bianca,"

           Law enforcement sources tell us ... police are investigating Ye after cops say they were told he punched a man in the face late Tuesday night -- but the guy he struck had allegedly pushed or grabbed West's wife,  Bianca Censori . 
       
           We're told Kanye and Bianca took off after the alleged altercation ... and, the alleged victim did not require treatment for injuries. 
       
           We're told police plan on reaching out to Kanye for his side of the story, and will also speak to witnesses. 
       
           This isn't the first time Ye's found himself at the center of a battery investigation ... remember, cops looked into a 2023 incident where video showed him  grabbing a photog's phone , and throwing it in an intersection. Ultimately, he wasn't charged. 
       
           Also, a man  sued Ye for assault and battery  earlier this year ... claiming the rap star struck him in downtown L.A., back in 2022, after saying ""I'm going to make a f***ing example of you."" 
       
           We've reached out to Kanye's team ... so far, no word back.

Coachella Weekend 2 Nailed with $28K Fine ... Due to Lana Del LATE!!!,"
           Coachella weekend 2 wrapped up on a low note, financially speaking, as the music festival is facing a $28,000 fine over  Lana Del Rey 's set. 
       
           A rep for the City of Indio, where Coachella takes place, tells TMZ ... the singer's show went over 13 minutes on Friday night. Might not sound like THAT bad of an infraction, but it's enough to trigger the hefty fine. 
       
           Lana's weekend 2 set featured 19 songs in total ... including a  surprise performance  from  Camila Cabello , who performed her new single, ""I LUV IT."" 
       
           However, we're told this is the only fine from the music festival's 2 weekends ... so, overall, the Coachella organizers probably see this as a win. 
       
           The $28K is a huge difference from last year's curfew violations, which resulted in  $117,000 in fines . Similarly, in 2022, the festival's 2 weekends -- plus 1 weekend of Stagecoach -- resulted in the city handing out $61K in fines. 
       
           Still, from what we've been told, this year's event was  noticeably less rowdy  than previous years. 
       
           As TMZ previously reported ... weekend 1 was down 20% in arrests and down 43% in citations. 
       
           Yet, this might have something to do with the  lackluster ticket sales  for this year's event. There were loads of Coachella passes still up for grabs on the website ... strikingly different from past years, where the event sold out in less than a day. 
       
           So, while the decrease in arrests and fines is good for the city ... it might be a bad sign for Coachella's future.

MINNESOTA CAR CRASH Up in Flames ... Driver Saved by Brave Passersby!!!,"
           A bunch of good Samaritans banded together to save a driver from a burning car at the very last second ... and the harrowing rescue is all on video. 
       
           Dash cam footage captured the tense scene moments after the driver veered off a highway in St. Paul, Minnesota ... crashing into a light pole. As the flames started spreading, several passersby sprang into action, feverishly trying to free the driver, who was trapped inside. 
       
           As you can see, as many as 6 people gripped the car doors and tried to force them open -- they were pinned against a guardrail -- so the driver could get out. 
       
           They had the whole car rocking as the flames grew higher and higher -- but it was impossible to get the doors open wide enough for the driver to squeeze out. 
       
           Kadir Tolla , whose dash cam captured the scene, then grabbed a piece of discarded plastic from the highway, and tried to smash the window ... but even that didn't do the trick. 
       
           Just when it seemed like time was running out -- several small explosions were erupting from under the hood -- a highway worker arrived and managed to break the driver's window, and they pulled the driver out to safety. 
       
           Tolla tells FOX Minneapolis, the situation was one of the scariest moments of his life -- but he stopped to help because he realized it could easily have been him in that situation, and he hoped strangers would lend a hand if he ever needed it. 
       
           Paramedics rushed the driver to Regions Hospital for medical evaluation ... and despite the terrifying ordeal, he miraculously did not sustain any serious injuries.

Comedian Elayne Boosler I Was Arrested At Dodger Game ... All 'Cause Of My Bag?!?,"
           Comedian  Elayne Boosler  says she was handcuffed and nearly thrown in the slammer after showing up to the Dodger game on Sunday ... claiming the whole debacle that led to her arrest was centered around a handbag. 
       
           The 71-year-old writer broke down her side of things following the alleged incident ... saying she wanted to check out the Dodgers' matinee matchup against the New York Mets, but was stopped by (in her opinion) a power-hungry stadium security guard over her baseball-themed purse. 
       
           Boosler said she was refused entry because the item didn't meet the venue's clear bag policy ... and she was told she could either take it back to her car, or throw it away. 
       
           Boosler didn't like that idea for a number of reasons ... but most notably, she felt she should get special treatment after all the free work she's done for the team over the years -- like singing the national anthem and participating in their celebrity softball games in the past. 
       
           The actress said she continued to raise a stink ... and when told she'd be arrested if she didn't leave, she replied, ""Fine. Arrest me."" 
       
           Sure enough, Boosler said she was cuffed and taken to the Dodger Stadium offices to be formally charged for trespassing ... and as she waited two hours to learn her fate, she cracked jokes that didn't really land well with her audience. 
       
           Despite the tough crowd, Boosler said officers were nice throughout the process ... which she chalked up to white privilege. 
       
           Ultimately, Boosler said she was told she wouldn't have to go to jail if she left the stadium ... which she agreed to do -- she called a ride and got the hell outta there. 
       
           Boosler bashed the organization over her alleged experience ... saying it should be ashamed of how everything played out -- and calling for the security guard to be fired for doing their job.

Adrien Broner Wants To Fight Devin Haney ... After Ryan Garcia Loss,"
           Adrien Broner   says  Devin Haney   needs him now more than ever -- after suffering the first loss of his career on Saturday -- with AB challenging the 31-1 boxer to a fight! 
       
           34-year-old Broner, 35-4, made a video addressing 25-year-old Haney after Saturday's fight at Barclays in Brooklyn ... one of the most shocking upsets of the year. 
       
           ""I know everybody waiting on my reaction, but I'mma just tell the truth,"" Broner said in an Instagram video. 
       
           ""Ay Devin! You gotta fight me now n****! S***, right now, you need me n****!"" 
       
           The fight offer was followed by some trolling ... AB took a shot at Haney's father,  Bill , who he's had beef with for some time. 
       
           ""Hold on, anybody seen Bill? Where the f*** is Bill at?!"" Broner said. ""Nah, we know where Devin at. Devin probably trying to get his thoughts together and s***. He'll be alright."" 
       
           ""Where the f*** Bill at?! Bill?!"" 
       
           Broner wasn't the only boxer throwing shade at the Haneys ...  Gervonta 'Tank' Davis , the only fighter to beat  Ryan Garcia ,   also trolled Devin and his crew. 
       
           ""Forget Devin.. WHERE BILL AT WHERE DIRT AT!!!!!!!!!"" Davis said on X. ""And what about you d**k riding ass people."" 
       
           ""I‚Äôm still coming to get n***** .. it‚Äôs not over! N***** gotta see me!"" 
       
           And, of course, Garcia -- who was a significant underdog after a bizarre fight camp -- also took shots, too ... saying Haney broke his jaw during the fight. 
       
           Devin said that's fake news ... but,  that loss  on Saturday was all too real. Stay tuned for DH's next move.

Sauce Gardner Scares Jets Fan After Pic W/ Drake ... Terrified Of The Curse!!!,"
           The Jets are no strangers to bad luck (Exhibit A,  Aaron Rodgers  last season) ... and that's why star Gang Green fans went into a full-on panic when star CB  Sauce Gardner  posted a photo with  Drake , fearing the famed Drizzy Curse would plague them in '24! 
       
           But, the young Pro Bowler is trying his best to assuage the fan's fears ... saying he's actually using the Drake Curse for good, to take down the 31 other NFL teams. 
       
           ""I told Drake that he should bet on all other 31 teams each week,"" the lockdown corner wrote on X. 
       
           ""Relax Jets fans.. we good."" 
       
           Sauce's comment comes after Jets supporters panicked after seeing the pic of the rapper, the CB, and  Odell Beckham Jr. 
       
           ""Bro stay the hell away from Drake,"" one fan commented on Gardner's photo. ""He gunna bet on us and screw it all up!"" 
       
           Of course, Drake has a long history of jinxing teams/athletes he supports. Just this past NCAA Tournament, Drizzy's preferred college basketball team, Kentucky, lost to 14 seed Oakland in the first round, arguably the biggest upset of the entire tournament. 
       
           He also supported #1 seeded Houston before the tourney kicked off ... and although UH made the Sweet 16, they lost to Duke. 
       
           In fairness to Drake, he has long supported the Toronto Raptors ... and the team won an NBA title in 2019, as Aubrey watched every home game from his courtside seats. But, bottom line, a lot of his teams have lost in big spots. 
       
           So, if something happens this upcoming season, you know who to blame! üëÄ

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift When Swifties Attack ... Kim Loses 100K Social Followers!!!,"
           Kim Kardashian 's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of  Taylor Swift  dropping a new diss track about the reality TV star. 
       
           ICYMI ... Taylor's new song, ""thanK you aIMee,"" is a thinly veiled revenge anthem against Kim -- hence the capitalized letters in the title. In the song, Taylor blasts a bully from her past ... slamming the woman as a ""bronze spray-tanned statue."" 
       
           And, only a few days after the track's release, Kim's lost more than 100,000 fans on social media ... with countless Swifties spamming her Instagram and X pages with vitriol. 
       
           One fan wrote ... ""Finally someone stood up to Aimee."" 
       
           Another said Kim should've apologized back in 2016, after she tried to paint Taylor as a liar by  releasing a private conversation  between the singer and her ex-husband,  Kanye West . 
       
           However, not everyone has viewed this new diss track as a negative ... with several of Kim's fans claiming this song has only further elevated the SKIMS mogul's fame. Others have called on Kim's momager  Kris Jenner  to cash in on the drama by responding to the diss track on the family's Hulu show. 
       
           BTW, losing 100K on social is basically a blip on Kim's radar -- she does still have 363 million, just on Instagram. 
       
           Taylor has made it no secret she's still upset with Kim all these years later -- in her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim by name for trying to get her canceled. 
       
           She said ... ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I‚Äôve never been before."" 
       
           Kim has ignored the drama for the most part ... but this might be over the fact her daughter,  North West , is a Taylor Swift fan -- which TS references in 'aIMee.' 
       
           There's no forgiving and forgetting here.

"Kodak Black I'm Off the Hook!!! Drug, Tampering Charges Dismissed","
           Kodak Black  can now place his recent drug possession case in his rearview mirror ... the last significant charge in the case was tossed out this week!!! 
       
           Court docs obtained by TMZ Hip Hop show a judge just dismissed the remaining tampering charge against the Florida rapper -- this after previously tossing the drug possession charges, back in February, after Kodak showed he had a prescription for the drugs. 
       
           Bradford Cohen , Kodak's attorney, tells TMZ Hip Hop ... ""The court recognized the valid arguments that were made to dismiss the last remaining count of this wrongful arrest. We are happy to see the case resolved and Kodak continue to be successful in both the entertainment world and his philanthropic ventures."" 
       
           Broward County State's Attorney's Office also confirmed the case is now over, aside from a traffic citation ... for double parking. 
       
           As we previously reported,  lab tests  determined the pills lifted off Kodak were actually oxycodone, and he showed a valid prescription for them. 
       
           His new single, ""Stressed Out,"" is probably a fitting description of his mood prior to getting the good news.
